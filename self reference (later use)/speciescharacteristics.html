<p>As a General Characteristic, striking a male Pok&#233;mon between the legs has no effect; it has been determined that male Pok&#233;mon keep their special male parts inside their body, only descending them, and thus leaving them vulnerable, during mating.</p>

<p><u>General Type Characteristics:</u></p>

<style>
| || || |_
</style>

<p><b>[Bug]:</b> Bug-types can see in the dark, and they have largely enhanced sight, granting them a small boost to the accuracy of their moves. Most live in warm climates, though they hate fire and dislike extreme cold. Their status inducing attacks have an extra 10% chance of inflicting statuses and the resulting statuses are slightly more potent than usual. Bug types are in general more nimble than other Pok&#233;mon, though not necessarily faster, and will quickly out manoeuvre opponents when using unconventional movement.</p>
<p><b>[Dark]:</b> Dark-types can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically at night and are more effective at hiding in dark environments than other Pok&#233;mon, though light does not adversely affect them. Their Dark type attacks will also become much more intimidating during the night, giving them a small additional chance to flinch. They are immune to the damaging effects of Psychic-type energy but may still be lifted and manipulated by telekinesis. They are slightly better at tricking opponents than other Pok&#233;mon, allowing them to plant more potent curses and to use moves like Feint Attack to greater effect.</p>
<p><b>[Dragon]:</b>Dragon-types tend to be strong swimmers and fliers, though they are not always as agile as other Pok&#233;mon. They fight more enthusiastically in warm climates but are less enthusiastic in colder ones. They radiate warmth from their core, and are slightly more resistant to chilling effects than other Pok&#233;mon. They are naturally very powerful Pok&#233;mon and their Dragon type attacks will have a stronger knockback than normal, but will deal no extra damage because of this.</p>
<p><b>[Electric]:</b> Electric types are resistant to paralysis inflicted by Electric-type moves, though they may be paralysed as normal by other methods. Electric types do not suffer from recoil damage when using Electric attacks in the water. They have a high degree of control over their Electric type attacks, and as such they will suffer less from attempts to redirect them.</p>
<p><b>[Fairy]:</b> Fairy-types are generally pure hearted and gregarious. They prefer natural environments and will fight more enthusiastically in them, but they will not be off put by urban environments. Any attack used by a Fairy-type which manipulates the environment is slightly more effective owing to the magical energies involved and attacks which boost allied Pok&#233;mon is slightly more effective at providing a buff. They are immune to the damaging effects of Dragon-typed energy.</p>
<p><b>[Fighting]:</b> Fighting-type Pok&#233;mon train extensively, more than any other Pok&#233;mon type, giving them greater endurance and readiness than other Pok&#233;mon and allowing them to push themselves harder for longer. They are more accurate with their physical blows and more adept at blocking and countering physical attacks, able to do this against most physical assaults. Being physically powerful, they can lift much more than normal Pok&#233;mon, though this does not grant them an attack boost. They fight more enthusiastically in urban environments but are not adversely affected by more natural surroundings.</p>
<p><b>[Fire]:</b> Fire-types fight most enthusiastically in hot and dry conditions. They are extremely difficult to burn and most can survive in hot liquids/molten lava for an extended period of time. Fire-type Pok&#233;mon are not adversely affected by taking dips in bodies of water, so long as the time is short. Their Fire type moves will be hotter than normal, allowing them to inflict more potent burns with a greater frequency, and their Fire type moves will naturally have a somewhat wider spread without a loss in power.</p>
<p><b>[Flying]:</b> Flying-type Pok&#233;mon are faster and more agile in their chosen mode of transportation than other Pok&#233;mon. Because of their skill in controlling their movement, they are more difficult to evade when using physical moves and more likely to succeed in dodging attacks. This also means that they are much harder to knock off course after gathering momentum. They are also more adept at commanding the wind, and they can use these attacks with slightly less energy than normal. Flying type Pok&#233;mon are affected normally by the damaging effects of Ground-typed energy and take neutral damage from Ground type moves in the ASB. They fight more enthusiastically in spacious arenas but are not put off by cramped conditions.</p>
<p><b>[Ghost]:</b> Ghost-type Pok&#233;mon fight more enthusiastically at night, though are not put off by fighting in the day, and can see in the dark. Ghosts are resistant to curses and curses imposed on them will last for a shorter time and be less potent. Their fear inducing attacks are more effective than those used by other Pok&#233;mon. Ghost types can be poisoned, unless stated otherwise. Ghost-types are not fully immune to Normal, Fighting or typeless attacks as in the games, taking neutral damage, but some may change their state in order to reduce damage from physical moves (see Ghost Pok&#233;mon information for details).</p>
<p><b>[Grass]:</b> Grass-type Pok&#233;mon live anywhere that can support vegetation and are adept at concealing themselves in such places. They enjoy both bright sun and rain and fight more enthusiastically in the day time, though they are not put off by fighting at night. Rainstorms will heal them slightly every round the rain falls, while very bright sunlight will regenerate their energy instead. Their healing moves cost slightly less energy and their draining moves will heal them by a greater amount while suffering only half of the usual diminishing returns. They are immune to spore based techniques like Sleep Powder and are more adept at using such attacks themselves, creating denser concentrations of spores which are harder to disperse and more potent in their effects. Any attack used by Grass-types manipulating the environment is slightly more potent, and their Grass-type attacks which utilise plant foliage (such as Razor Leaf) are more efficient in natural environments.</p>
<p><b>[Ground]:</b> Ground-type Pok&#233;mon are considered to be immune to electricity while standing on the ground. If a Ground Pok&#233;mon is in the air, they take 0.75x the usual damage from Electric-type attacks, and will take neutral damage from Electric when wet. Ground types do not suffer from recoil damage when using Electric attacks in the water. Ground-type Pok&#233;mon are more adept at manipulating outdoor and 'natural' environments than other Pok&#233;mon and will spend less energy using Dig, Earthquake etc. This allows them to use Ground attacks on any surface, with the exception of Dig. They can also cause the ground to shake more vigorously when using Earthquake and Bulldoze.</p>
<p><b>[Ice]:</b> Ice-type Pok&#233;mon are highly resistant to cold and fight more enthusuastically in cold environments. However, they hate hot temperatures, and will not fight as enthusiastically. If their STAB attacks have a secondary effect, they are slightly more likely to have their effects triggered. Their Ice type moves are significantly colder than those used by any other Pok&#233;mon, giving them a much greater ability to numb and slow the foe. In addition, any areas frozen by an Ice type will become sore even after the ice has been knocked loose, creating a painful area like Crush Claw does. Their chilled bodies allow them to create ice more readily than other Pok&#233;mon, significantly speeding up their Ice type attacks. Ice-types are generally sure footed and difficult to knock over, moving with ease across slippery surfaces and through strong winds and storms.</p>
<p><b>[Mega]:</b> Pok&#233;mon in their Mega Forme are considered one level higher than their base form. In Mega Forme, they therefore have all the benefits and drawbacks of uplevels. If a Pok&#233;mon which is already an uplevel Mega Evolves, it can trigger disobedience on its own. Transforming to Mega works like conventional switching; it does not cost a move, but must be the first thing done in a round and (if done going second) allows the opponent a re-order. Once in this Forme, Pok&#233;mon may not change back until they faint.</p>
<p><b>[Normal]:</b> Normal-type Pok&#233;mon are able to use support moves to greater effect than other Pok&#233;mon, with them being performed slightly quicker and being slightly more potent. Being beings of great balance, they benefit more from the positive effects of weather and other arena affecting moves, but will not suffer as badly from the negative effects. In the ASB, Normal-types take resisted damage from the damaging effects of Ghost-type energy.</p>
<p><b>[Poison]:</b> Poison-type Pok&#233;mon are immune to poisoning. Their Poison-type attacks are slightly more likely to succeed in poisoning their targets than those used by other Pok&#233;mon and the effects will be slightly more potent. They also have an additional 10% chance to poison the target when using physical attacks with their most venomous appendages e.g. a Seviperâ€™s tail, a Nidokingâ€™s horn.</p>
<p><b>[Psychic]:</b> Psychic-type Pok&#233;mon are much more proficient with telekinesis than other Pok&#233;mon. Thus, they can use Psychic to move and manipulate targets with ease. Psychic type Pok&#233;mon are resistant to flinching, having higher levels of focus and concentration than other Pok&#233;mon. They are resistant to attacks which induce confusion or other mental effects. They have limited ability to read minds and are thus more adept at dodging attacks than might be expected and able to mitigate the effects of accuracy reducing attacks. This extends to GMs, where they will have a slightly better impression of Pok&#233;mon within their vicinity. Their Psychic support moves (such as Gravity and Magic Room) cost slightly less energy.</p>
<p><b>[Rock]:</b> Rock-type Pok&#233;mon generally have hard bodies, which makes them resistant to physical hits and projectiles. They are also resistant to XX attacks. This defensive ability extends to their moves, making defensive attacks like Protect and Harden cost less energy. They are difficult to burn or poison and prefer hot environments to cold ones. Most are so heavy that they will sink in water, so they stay away from deep-water sources if possible. They are adept at controlling rocks and will use less energy than other Pok&#233;mon when using Rock Tomb, Stealth Rock etc. to manipulate the arena.</p>
<p><b>[Steel]:</b> Steel-type Pok&#233;mon generally have tempered bodies, meaning they take slightly reduced damage from physical attacks. Their Steel type attacks are more proficient at cutting through energy, allowing them to reduce damage while breaking through them, unlike other Pok&#233;mon. Most are so heavy that they will sink in water, so they stay away from deep-water sources if possible, though they are not bothered by water to the degree Rock-types are. Most Steel Pok&#233;mon prefer cold temperatures to hot ones. Steel-types are resistant to XX and take neutral damage from the damaging effects of Normal-type energy in the ASB, as opposed to resisted damage in the games. They are immune to the damaging effects of Poison-type energy and are difficult to poison.</p>
<p><b>[Water]:</b> Water-type Pok&#233;mon are generally able to hold their breath and/or breathe underwater. The time varies, from several rounds in the case of birds, mammals and reptiles to indefinitely for fish and squid like Pok&#233;mon. They are generally good swimmers, with fish excelling the most, and are better at manipulating Water for moves like Surf and Whirlpool than other Pok&#233;mon, using less energy to do so even outside of water. Their Surf and Whirlpool attacks do not lose potency when used without a water source.</p>

<p>Abomasnow (Grass/Ice): Abomasnow are able to disguise themselves well in blizzards and snowy areas. Their Hail attack is far more effective than normal, starting faster and dealing mild damage to any non Ice-types on the field for each round it is in effect. Like a Tyranitar uses sand, Abomasnow can generate a hailstorm from its own body and can thus use the technique indoors. Their Blizzard attack takes slightly less energy than normal. In its Mega Forme, Abomasnow is larger and bulkier than normal in exchange for being slightly slower. Abomasnow's attacks are all somewhat more powerful and it is slightly more resistant to both physical and special blows, but its bulky, heavy form does not allow for a significant range of movement. Against any Pok&#233;mon that would reasonably be afraid of Mega Abomasnow, a Mega Abomasnow's fear-inducing attacks are more effective.</p>
<p>Abra (Psychic): Abra sleep most of their life. Therefore, they are more resistant (but not completely immune) to sleep-inducing attacks and are able to aim their attacks instinctively when using Sleep Talk. Abra can see in the dark. Teleporting also requires slightly less energy.</p>
<p>Absol (Dark): Due to their ability to predict disasters, Absol have a faster reaction time to large-scale attacks such as Earthquake and Blast Burn. This does not guarantee escape but increases the odds of dodging. Absol are considered symbols of woe amongst Pok&#233;mon and people, particularly when seen at night, so they may make opponents feel uneasy. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy. In its Mega Forme Absol's reaction time increases greatly, allowing it to more easily evade attacks, especially those that are high powered or particularly threatening or dangerous. The horn atop their head also becomes more defined, giving them a slight boost to attacks using it.</p>
<p>Accelgor (Bug): Accelgor are extremely speedy and nimble, able to move at almost lightning speed. They can levitate. Their body is very moist underneath the wrappings and they will feel unenthusiastic if in a dry environment. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Aegislash (Steel/Ghost): Aegislash are a possessed swords and shield, their body made entirely of the blade, making them inorganic. All attacks involving slashing get a 20% boost in power. They levitate by default, but prefer to remain still when attacking and defending. When Aegislash are sent out, they will start in Shield Forme, giving taking 80% damage from all attacks. When ordered to use any attack, they will go into Blade Forme, losing this boost. They may enter Shield Forme using a move. Defensive moves that seek to reduce damage from a move, such as Iron Defense, King's Shield or Protect will cause Aegislash to automatically enter this forme. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Aerodactyl (Rock/Flying): Aerodactyl are a terrifying sight and its fear-inducing attacks are more effective. Aerodactyl's biting moves are 1.2x more powerful than those of other Pok&#233;mon. Though not particularly agile, Aerodactyl are powerful fliers. They use less energy when carrying other Pok&#233;mon and can lift 1.5x the weight that most other Flying-type Pok&#233;mon could. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often. In its Mega Forme Aerodactyl gains a number of sharp spikes, making physical contact and grabbing/wrap attacks painful for the Pok&#233;mon wrapping it. These spikes also increase the power of its physical contact attacks, increasing them by 10%, as well as giving them the potential to pierce or slash.</p>
<p>Aggron (Steel/Rock): Aggron can see in the dark. Due to their exceptional hardness, they will not take recoil damage from attacks they use and are highly resistant to physical moves, taking only 80% damage. In its Mega Forme Aggron's body hardens into a carapace of high strength metal, becoming a pure Steel type. It is fairly resistant to physical strikes, and only powerful physical attacks will deal noticeable damage to them.</p>
<p>Aipom (Normal): Aipom are nimble, particularly with their tails, and are excellent climbers. They can anchor themselves to something with their tails, leaving their limbs free to do other things, though they prefer to use their tails for attacks traditionally used with the arms. They are also more likely to stop from falling if there's something within grabbing distance of their tail. </p>
<p>Alakazam (Psychic): Alakazam emit special alpha waves as a by-product of its psychic abilities. These waves induce headaches and will disrupt the concentration of Pok&#233;mon within 5 feet of it. Alakazam's telekinetic abilities allow it to lift Pok&#233;mon twice as heavy as normal for no increased energy cost. An Alakazam has one of the most acute minds amongst Pok&#233;mon, with the exception of some legendaries. Thus, they are difficult to deceive or outwit and any mentally effecting attack will be less effective and less likely to succeed against one. They are also more resistant (but not completely immune) to sleep-inducing attacks. Alakazam can see in the dark. In its Mega Forme, it gains extremely potent telekinetic abilities and is capable of having full, unobstructed Psychic "vision" of its surroundings, regardless of Dark energy that might normally block it. It can also levitate without using energy and use its telekinesis to lift objects of almost any size for relatively low amounts of energy.</p>
<p>Alomomola (Water): Alomomola are natural healers. As such, all attacks dealing with healing are significantly more effective. Their defensive stats are slightly higher than those of other Water-types. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Altaria (Dragon/Flying): Altaria's song-based attacks are slightly more effective than normal. On a cloudy day, Altaria can be sightly difficult to see in the air. They are strong fliers and surprisingly fast. In its Mega Forme, Altaria becomes a beautiful fairy, now Dragon/Fairy type. Despite losing its Flying type, they are still strong fliers, but may now also float in addition to their flight capabilities, able to both levitate and fly. The large fluffy clouds surrounding its body give it a slight boost to its defenses. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Fairy energy, causing them to become Fairy typed.</p>
<p>Amaura (Rock/Ice): Amaura's body is extremely frigid. When performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Ice energy, causing them to become Ice typed. Using 10% more energy, they can also increase the chance of their Ice-typed moves freezing their target by 5%. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Ambipom (Normal): Ambipom are nimble, particularly with their tails, and are excellent climbers. They can anchor themselves to something with their tails, leaving their limbs free to do other things, though they prefer to use their tails for attacks traditionally used with the arms. They are also more likely to stop from falling if thereÃ¢â�¬â�¢s something within grabbing distance of their tail. They can also use their tails to chain physical attacks with much greater ease than other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Amoongus (Grass/Poison): When attacked physically or threatened, Amoongus may release a small amount of spores causing a random mild status effect. Their spores and powders are somewhat more effective and spread in dense clouds. They are resistant to being afflicted with status moves.</p>
<p>Ampharos (Electric): An Ampharos's pelt is slightly charged and any Pok&#233;mon not resistant to electricity who comes into physical contact with Mareep has a 20% chance of flinching, subject to diminishing returns. Ampharos have the ability to use the balls on their tails as lights. While not as powerful as a Flash attack, they light up the arena without blinding opponents or allies, and doing so takes almost no energy to maintain. It is considered one move for Ampharos to light its tail. This will, however, make it a more obvious target for Pok&#233;mon who can see in dark areas. In addition, their Charge Beam attack is much more potent, guaranteeing the boost when it is used. In its Mega Forme, Ampharos gains an additional Dragon typing and a far greater range of control and power of it's illumination ability. The buildup of energy in its wool also causes it to be in a permanent state of Charge.</p>
<p>Anorith (Rock/Bug): Anorith are adept swimmers. Despite their weakness to water, they can swim without taking damage. As deep sea Pok&#233;mon, they can hold their breath for a long time, about as long as the average Water-type. Though still weak to Water attacks, they are somewhat less vulnerable than other Rock-types and take somewhat less damage. Their claw based moves deal 1.1x damage. They are familiar with the Water type. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Araquanid (Water/Bug): Araquanid are adept both on land and in water, being able to propel themselves with their bubble when submerged. Their Water type attacks are amplified by the watery bubble surrounding their body, dealing an additional 20% damage. In addition, this barrier will significantly reduce the power of incoming Fire moves.</p>
<p>Arbok (Poison): Arbok are fairly intimidating Pok&#233;mon and their fear-inducing attacks are more effective, as are their poisons. They can see in the dark and are good swimmers that can hold their breath longer than most Pok&#233;mon. They are also fairly effective burrowers, digging at a greater speed than the average non-Ground-type.</p>
<p>Arcanine (Fire): Arcanine are extremely loyal and brave. They are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are also more resistant to fear-inducing effects. As dogs they are quite good diggers and deal 1.2x damage with their biting attacks. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Their Roar attack is significantly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Arceus (Normal): Arceus is rumored to be the creator of the entire Pok&#233;mon world, and therefore is an extremely powerful being. Arceus's body once encompassed all 18 types, but these essences have since been flung around the world in the form of 17 plates. Arceus may be equipped with these plates to change its type from Normal to whatever type the plate represents, filling its Attachable slot. With a plate attached, Arceus will assume all weaknesses, resistances, familiarities and associated type SC qualities. Arceus is capable of levitation-like flight, allowing it to fly fast and nimbly through the air. It is also fairly adept on the ground if ground travel is needed.</p>
<p>Archen (Rock/Flying): Archen are mediocre flyers, though they are able to hop quite a distance and glide somewhat. They are adept climbers. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Archeops (Rock/Flying): Archeops are much closer to a raptor than a bird and, despite being perfectly decent fliers, prefer to run. Their speed on the ground is relatively impressive, though they are not terribly agile. They are adept climbers. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Ariados (Bug/Poison): Ariados may shoot strands of webbing out of both their fronts and rears. While not powerful enough to damage Pok&#233;mon, they can use it to pull themselves from place to place more quickly without it counting as a move. Ariados can climb walls and other objects with ease. Their web attacks will be more effective than usual and cost less energy. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Armaldo (Rock/Bug): Armaldo are adequate swimmers, though not as maneuverable as Anorith. They have no problem with watery environments. As a deep sea Pok&#233;mon, they can hold their breath for a long time, about as long as the average Water-type. Though still weak to Water attacks, they are somewhat less vulnerable than other Rock-types and take somewhat less damage. Their claw based moves deal 1.2x damage. They are familiar with the Water-type. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Aromatisse (Fairy): Aromatisse emit a pleasant scent constantly. Any Pok&#233;mon that comes within 5 feet of Aromatisse will suffer the effects of Sweet Scent. Any moves involving gasses or scents will be more potent and will linger for a longer period of time. Aromatisse are also able to release a sour, spicy or bitter smell in order to distract or irritate foes in a manner similar to Cotton Spore. This effect comes with diminishing returns. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Spritzee line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. They levitate by default but have a low flight ceiling.</p>
<p>Aron (Steel/Rock): Aron can see in the dark. Due to their exceptional hardness, they will not take recoil damage from attacks they use and take slightly less damage from physical attacks.</p>
<p>Articuno (Ice/Flying): Articuno is the legendary bird of ice. The air is significantly colder 10 feet around it, decreasing the power of grass and fire attacks in its vicinity. Its Hail attack is much more powerful than normal, starting almost instantly at full power, lasting twice as long as usual and being much harder to change against Articuno's wishes, and its Blizzard attack requires slightly less energy. Articuno also becomes almost invisible in a snow/hailstorm.</p>
<p>Audino (Normal): Audino have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They are skilled healers and their healing moves are slightly more effective than normal. They are also skilled at hiding and will be able to conceal themselves more easily than normal. In its Mega Forme, Audino becomes a graceful Fairy, becoming Normal/Fairy type. Its healing moves use 25% less energy. Its presence in the arena is calming, lessening the effectiveness of rage-based moves. It can also use its stethoscope-like feeler to put a foe to sleep quickly, using a move; due to its calming aura, this sleep is faster than normal and can be used even on normally irritable or restless foes.</p>
<p>Aurorus (Rock/Ice): Aurorus' body is extremely frigid. When performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Ice energy, causing them to become Ice typed. Using 10% more energy, they can also increase the chance of their Ice-typed moves freezing their target by 10%. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Avalugg (Ice): Avalugg's large, hefty body is hard as steel, but also causes them to be relatively slow. Their thick carapace of ice mean that take 80% damage from physical attacks. Their icy body is extremely cold. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind.</p>
<p>Axew (Dragon): Axew's tusks are tough and sharp. Any attacks utilizing these tusks are granted a 1.1x boost in power.</p>
<p>Azelf (Psychic): Azelf naturally levitates nimbly and quickly, able to maneuver in the air with ease. Due to being the spirit of willpower, Azelf will endure for one round after it should have been KO'd. Due to its determination, it is unaffected by fear or intimidation tactics. Azelf is a powerful being, with its offensive boosting moves' potency being increased. Azelf is able to manifest its powerful will through its offensive Psychic techniques, with the attacks having stronger knockback than normal. Azelf's red gems boost its Psychic abilities, granting it much greater proficiency with non-damaging Psychic moves as well as a slightly higher offensive power with Psychic attacks.</p>
<p>Azumarill (Water/Fairy): An AzumarillÃ¢â�¬â�¢s hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves. Azumarill may use their tail-balls as a floatation device, making it difficult to force one underwater if it does not wish to do so. Their fur actively repels water, meaning they can swim in even the strongest of currents almost effortlessly, easily escaping traps like Whirlpool. Their tail is flexible and can be extended to improve the reach for moves, and they can use it to aid their Bounce attack, clearing significantly more distance than normal.</p>
<p>Azurill (Normal/Fairy): An Azurill's hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making it more vulnerable to sound-based status moves. Azurill may use their tail-balls as a floatation device, making it difficult to force one underwater if it does not wish to do so. Despite lacking the Water-type of their evolutions, Azurill's aquatic lifestyle makes it a decent swimmer and grants it familiarity with Water-type moves, as well as increased Water energy. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Bagon (Dragon): Bagon's skulls are very tough and, as a result, attacks Bagon performs with their head do 1.1x damage, while any physical attack that strikes Bagon's skull will only do 80% damage. Bagon can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Baltoy (Ground/Psychic): As living dreidels, techniques which focus on spinning will be quicker to use and more effective than normal when used by Baltoy. They levitate by default and are inorganic. </p>
<p>Banette (Ghost): Banette are nearly always solid, but can become ethereal or invisible for short periods of time. They levitate by default. Their Curse attack only cuts half the normal health it normally would for other Ghost types, but the target will take the damage it would have taken if Banette had sacrificed the normal amount. Banette's Curse does not fade away at all if Banette is KOed or far from its target. They resist moves which induce sleep and will wake up faster than usual when put to sleep against their will. If another Pok&#233;mon makes contact with them using a move, there is a 20% chance that that move will be disabled for a period of three rounds. They are immune to being poisoned. In its Mega Forme, Banette transforms into a spiteful trickster spirit, capable of manipulating its foe without them even noticing. Any non-offensive move executed by Banette will be more potent, but this will not have an effect on Curse.</p>
<p>Barbaracle (Rock/Water): Barbaracle are made up of a number of symbiotic organisms, each having a separate mind that is linked to the larger organism. This allows them to perform multiple actions simultaneously. They are fairly resistant to Water-type moves despite their Rock-type and take slightly less damage from them. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Barboach (Water/Ground): Barboach are naturally wet, their slime making them difficult to hold onto and grab and preventing them from being affected by Electric attacks. Their movements are awkward out of water. Their whiskers can also help locate a real opponent if it is nearby when using techniques such as Double Team or in places with limited visibility and they can see in the dark. These Pok&#233;mon can set off earthquakes with ease and any earth-based ground attacks are quicker to use and will require less energy. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Basculin (Water): Basculin come in two forms, one with a red stripe and one with a blue stripe. These two types also vary in fin and eye shape, but these differences are largely aesthetic. Basculin are extremely aggressive and territorial, and two Basculin with different colored stripes may turn on each other in a blind rage. Their biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.1x more damage than usual. When Basculin latch on to something with their teeth, they are more difficult to shake or pry off. Basculin are more effective in numbers. When battling alongside another fish Pok&#233;mon, they gain a boost in confidence that gives them a boost in attack. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Bastiodon (Rock/Steel): Bastiodon's face plates are thick and extremely sturdy. Physical hits done to them will deal only 80% damage. Charging attacks and headbutts are 20% more effective. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Bayleef (Grass): Bayleef have a spicy smell to them, which makes Pok&#233;mon much less likely to obey defensive commands, affecting all Pok&#233;mon within 3 feet of Bayleef. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon are unaffected as are members of the Chikorita line. However, using a move, they may intensify this spicy fragrance, which will give all Pok&#233;mon within 5 feet of Bayleef a boost to their offensive stats. Members of the Chikorita line, including the user, are not immune to this and will be affected. This intensified scent will automatically stop secreting a round after being initially produced. They have two vines that extend from the leaves on their neck, allowing them to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Beartic (Ice): Beartic are surprisingly adept swimmers, able to both swim powerfully on the surface and stay underwater for a good period, though they will likely need air at least once in the course of a battle, depending on energy exhaustion. Beartic's forelegs are extremely powerful, doing additional damage to any attack used with them. They are large and intimidating so their fear attacks are more effective. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Beautifly (Bug/Flying): Beautifly are rather aggressive, making them more vulnerable to rage-inducing moves, but they will have a greater attack boost as a result. Draining attacks used by Beautifly drain faster and are more potent than those used by other Pok&#233;mon if they are administered via their proboscis. Their Silver Wind attack is more potent, offering them the boost slightly more often. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Beedrill (Bug/Poison): Beedrill are more effective in numbers and, when battling alongside another Bug-typed Pok&#233;mon, gain a boost in confidence that raises their attack. Their Poison Sting and Twineedle attacks have an increased chance to poison, also dealing slightly more damage than usual. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage. Beedrill are intimidating Pok&#233;mon, particularly in numbers. Multiple Beedrill, Combee and Vespiquen on the same side share a hive mind, meaning that one cannot be surprised unless they all are and one cannot be affected mentally unless they all are. Their attacks also become more coordinated, making it harder for the foe to dodge combination attacks. In its Mega Forme, Beedrill becomes a fierce and extremely fast attacker. Its needle and spear-based attacks are 10% more effective. It is also an extremely fast flier.</p>
<p>Beheeyem (Psychic): Beheeyem are extremely intelligent Pok&#233;mon with potent psychic capabilities. They levitate by default. They are telepathic, giving them all of the bonuses associated with Mind Reader without the usual drop in speed. Being a cosmic entity, their Cosmic Power is significantly more potent than usual.</p>
<p>Beldum (Steel/Psychic): Beldum levitate by default but have a lower flight ceiling than most Pok&#233;mon and are not particularly agile. They are inorganic. Their tackling attacks are slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>Bellossom (Grass): Bellossom are talented dancers and any dancing attack is more effective. The sun provides them with more of a boost than other Grass-types. Bellossom have a calming smell. Any Pok&#233;mon within five feet who smell it will have their offensive stats reduced significantly. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Oddish line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. It can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Bellsprout (Grass/Poison): Bellsprout moves on spindly roots and is not particularly fast or agile. Their Ingrain technique is much more effective than normal and their Acid based attacks deal 1.1x the normal damage. They have two vines hidden beneath their pitcher that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. Bellsprout, despite their size, are mostly hollow, with most of their body dedicated to their pitcher. They can attempt to grab and swallow anything smaller than them in their pitcher. This counts as a two-move combo and they can attempt no other moves that round. However, they are considered to use Giga Drain on anything inside of them automatically each round, draining health and energy from the opponent and giving it to Bellsprout (this does not count as a move). Due to the digestive fluids contained within, victims are essentially bathed in Acid and will suffer the effects of that move as well as passive damage over time. This lasts until the Pok&#233;mon escapes or Bellsprout or the Pok&#233;mon inside are KO'ed, in which case Bellsprout will eject the Pok&#233;mon. Pok&#233;mon inside Bellsprout may still be ordered, though their first priority will be to escape. Bellsprout's pitchers have slippery walls and are half-filled with digestive fluids.</p>
<p>Bergmite (Ice): Bergmite's icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind. Their bodies are also tough and they take only 90% damage from physical attacks.</p>
<p>Beware (Normal/Fighting): Bewear possesses overwhelming strength that even it cannot always control. It is quite friendly and jovial, but can be very aggressive if angered. Its grappling attacks are quite powerful, doing 20% more damage than average, and are difficult to break free from. Its fluffy fur gives it a significant boost to its defense, but it is slightly more vulnerable to Fire attacks as a consequence.</p>
<p>Bibarel (Normal/Water): A relatively simple minded Pok&#233;mon, Bibarel are more likely to misinterpret conditional commands, but are immune to confusion and resistant to other mind-altering attacks. They can use materials from the environment to build barriers and shelters in the same way that beavers can build dams. Bibarel also have powerful teeth, and so any biting attack will deal 1.2x more damage, and their Aqua Tail is more powerful than normal.</p>
<p>Bidoof (Normal): A relatively simple minded Pok&#233;mon, Bidoof are more likely to misinterpret conditional commands, but are immune to confusion and resistant to other mind-altering attacks. They can use materials from the environment to build barriers and shelters in the same way that beavers can build dams. Bidoof also have powerful teeth, and so any biting attack will deal 1.1x more damage, and their Aqua Tail is more powerful than normal.</p>
<p>Binacle (Rock/Water): A single Binacle actually consists of two organisms bound to a rock. Although they appear sessile and bound to their rock, they are able to move by crawl on their two heads using their stretchy necks or hop short distances. They can also detach their bodies from the rock to perform attacks, but cannot be forceably removed and generally refuse to travel more than a few meters from it. Since they are both separate organisms, each head is able to act independently to perform two moves simultaneously, but they will both be affected equally by mentally-affecting attacks. They are fairly resistant to Water-type moves despite their Rock-type and take slightly less damage from them. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Bisharp (Dark/Steel): Bisharp's bodies have multiple sharp steel blades on them, which it can use for attack or defense. Pok&#233;mon directly attacking Bisharp risk lacerations and 25% recoil damage. Their bladed arms grant them a x1.2 boost to slashing moves, and their precise edge has a chance to leave a vulnerable spot on the stricken area.</p>
<p>Blastoise (Water): The largest of their evolutionary line, Blastoise are the least agile of the three. However, they are much tougher. Their shell is harder and heavier, and they are the fastest of the line in the water and on land. They are vulnerable if knocked on their backs and have a hard time getting up, though Blastoise are harder to knock down and attacks that strike their back suffer from a slight drop in power. Their Water Gun, Hydro Pump and Hydro Cannon attacks are slightly more powerful than those of other Pok&#233;mon and are launched from their cannons. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health. In its Mega Forme Blastoise's back cannons fuse into one giant cannon and it gains wrist cannons. Blastoise is capable of firing from all three cannons, and when ordered to do so, will gain a 20% boost to any attacks fired from its cannons. It is also capable of using only the central cannon or its wrist cannons at the standard damage level but for the standard energy level. Firing from its main cannon will allow the attack to travel faster and farther, but firing them from its wrist cannons will allow Blastoise to aim more precisely or split its attack to hit multiple targets. While any attack that can be reasonably fired from a Pok&#233;mon's mouth may be fired from either Blastoise's back or wrist cannons, only Water and Pulse (Aura Sphere, Dragon Pulse, Dark Pulse, Water Pulse) moves can be fired from all three cannons at once to gain the power boost.</p>
<p>Blaziken (Fire/Fighting): Blaziken are exceptional jumpers and can leap up to three times their head height. Kicking attacks will do slightly more damage then normal. Blaziken have flames on their wrists and can control whether their flames are ignited at any one time. However, they cannot use any fire attacks if their fire is not ignited. Igniting does not count as a move, and happens automatically when the Pok&#233;mon is ordered a fire attack. However, de-igniting counts as a move and they will automatically de-ignite if they fall asleep. Their flames can be used to burn foes if there is prolonged contact and can provide illumination. They are also familiar with the Flying type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health. In its Mega Forme, Blaziken becomes an extremely fast, nimble and adept fighter. Blaziken moves with great speed, allowing it to rapidly change positions to evade attacks, jump exceedingly high and far, and close even great distances to deliver assaults. Their fast striking speed allows them to more easily combo physical moves.</p>
<p>Blissey (Normal):  Blissey are resistant to special attacks and will take less damage from them. However, they are weak to physical attacks, and take more damage from them than normal. Their physical attack stat is also slightly weaker than normal. They are excellent healers and healing moves used to benefit other Pok&#233;mon will cost them a good bit less energy than normal. They emanate a calming aura, being less vulnerable to anger-based attacks and calming all Pok&#233;mon on the field.</p>
<p>Blitzle (Electric): Blitzle are brimming with electrical energy, often releasing small amounts through their mane, causing it to flash brightly. Their mane can be illuminated for a longer period of time, allowing them to illuminate an area much like an Ampharos. Blitzle, though quite fast, are not nearly as fast as their evolution, but somewhat more agile. When using Agility, they leave a trail of sparks, which do light Electric damage to anything that walks over or stands on them. Any attack they execute with their hooves is 1.1x as powerful.</p>
<p>Boldore (Rock): Despite resembling eyes, the holes on Boldore's face are actually ears, making them effectively blind. However, these ears are extremely sensitive to vibrations both in the earth and the air, allowing them to detect their foe despite any visual obstructions. The orange gems on their bodies are shiny and glow when energy-based attacks are used, which can possibly give away their position when using the attack or help allies see in dark spaces. Their damage dealing light based moves deal 1.1x damage. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Bonsly (Rock): Bonsly are capable of holding perfectly still, which makes them almost impossible to detect if they're hiding in forested or woody areas. Like Grass types, they enjoy both bright sun and rain and fight more enthusiastically in the day time, though they are not put off by fighting at night. They are very good at using Mimic and can Mimic attacks with less energy and more flexibility in terms of the type energy for the attacks Mimicked. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Bouffalant (Normal): Bouffalant's afro is soft and fabulous, acting as a buffer against attacks and recoil damage. Their whole head is actually quite heavy due to the large mass of hair and horns, giving it a x1.2 boost to attacks involving headbutting.</p>
<p>Bounsweet (Grass): Bounsweet releases a sweet, calming scent from its body. This scent calms Pok&#233;mon within 3 feet of them, lowering their Defense. It moves primarily by bouncing, and it's light frame can cause it to get caught in drafts of wind.</p>
<p>Braixen (Fire): Braixen are amateur Psychics, slightly more adept than their previous forms at manipulating their Fire attacks. Using a move, Braixen can be ordered to draw the twig from their tail, lighting it. They can use this twig as a light source or to direct their Fire attacks, or possibly as a source for their moves (at the cost of light energy). However, if the twig is stolen or extinguished, they will be unable to direct their Fire attacks and will have to relight it using a Fire move or by lighting it with their tail again. They are familiar with the Psychic type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Braviary (Normal/Flying): Braviary are extremely confident Pok&#233;mon and are difficult to intimidate or beguile. Attacks using fear or intimidating tactics are much less effective on Braviary. Their powerful wings and talons are designed to lift foes, allowing them to lift Pok&#233;mon 1.5x their weight, though lifting Pok&#233;mon that weigh more than Braviary will take much more energy. Attacks made using their talons deal 1.2x damage.</p>
<p>Breloom (Grass/Fighting): Breloom's arms are extremely stretchy, allowing them to hit their foe from a distance with punches. Their punches are also incredibly quick, and will deal x1.2 extra damage. Breloom's spores and powders are somewhat more effective and spread in denser clouds than usual. They are resistant to being afflicted with status moves.</p>
<p>Brionne (Water): Brionne is an acrobatic Pok&#233;mon, both on land and in the water. While it favors swimming and is agile and fast in water, its movement on land, while not terribly fast, is still fairly agile. Brionne can form large bubbles that are more stable than average, which it can use to bounce into the air to move about or evade attacks, costing a move to do so. Its bubble-based attacks are 10% more potent and will more easily break through screens or other attacks due to their increased durability. Brionne are also very dramatic, making moves such as Disarming Voice more likely to cause the opponent to falter. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Bronzong (Steel/Psychic): Bronzong may levitate a short distance above the ground, though they move rather slowly, and are inorganic. Bronzong are a bit more resistant to heat than other Steel-types. Due to being a literal bell, Bronzong's sound moves are slightly more effective, resonate more clearly, and suffer from less diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Bronzor (Steel/Psychic): Brnzor levitate by default and are inorganic. They take 10% less damage from Fire moves than other Steel-types.</p>
<p>Bruxish (Water/Psychic): Bruxish, despite their garish appearance, are rather good at hiding. They can bury themselves in sand using a move and use the protuberance on their head to detect their foes with their psychic abilties. They have very strong jaws that give them a 20% boost to biting attacks. Using a move, they can also gnash their teeth loudly, which causes irritation in those who hear it and can distract the foe similar to Screech.</p>
<p>Budew (Grass/Poison): As a rose bud, Budew emanate a soothing scent constantly that acts much the same way as Sweet Scent. Its effects are more potent in close quarters, but quickly lose strength and are less powerful than other members of their line. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Budew line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Buizel (Water): Buizel use their tails similar to a propeller. This allows them to control their speed in the water and make sharp turns with great ease. They can rotate their tails like helicopter blades and levitate, though they are neither fast nor agile at this. The ring around their necks can be used as a floatation device, making them hard to force underwater. It may also be inflated and used as a shield, granting a small boost to physical defense. Buizel are slightly faster than the average Water-type on land.</p>
<p>Bulbasaur (Grass/Poison): Bulbasaur are the most agile, though not fastest, of their line. They have two vines hidden beneath their bulb that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Buneary (Normal): Buneary are able to jump much higher than the typical Pok&#233;mon. They can use their ears in attacks, allowing them to extend their range for physical attacks.</p>
<p>Bunnelby (Normal): Despite being a Normal-type, Bunnelby are extremely adept diggers, able to form stable tunnels and stay underground for extended periods of time. They are familiar with the Ground type.</p>
<p>Burmy (Bug): Burmy can blend into the environment with ease, and are capable of staying perfectly still to avoid detection. They can hold onto things with their appendage on their head. This appendage is extendible and can be used like a Spinarak's web to move around more quickly. They are also able to take camouflage from the environment when their coat is knocked off, adapting nearby debris to form a new one. They are immune to weather damage like Sandstorm and Hail.</p>
<p>Butterfree (Bug/Flying): Butterfree have potent spore based attacks which are more effective than normal and produce denser clouds, travelling further as a result. They are familiar with the Psychic type. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Buzzwole (Bug/Fighting): Buzzwole has near unparalleled strength, and punching attacks gain a 20% boost in power due to this. Their Leech Life attack also deals significantly more damage. Whenever Buzzwole uses Swagger, it pulls an abrupt pose, strengthening the anger inducing effect of their Swagger attack. Their hardened carapaces will reduce incoming physical damage by 10%, and whenever Buzzwole manages to defeat an opponent, it gains a slight boost to its physical defence.</p>
<p>Cacnea (Grass): Cacnea are covered in spikes. Therefore, those who attack them with physical attacks will take roughly 25% recoil damage (unless they are particularly hard bodied) and their Needle Arm attack is more effective than normal. Being native to the desert where Sandstorms are frequent, Cacnea are immune to the effects of the attack and can see through them easily. They fight more enthusiastically in sandy or dusty areas. They can see in the dark. They are capable of standing very still, making them difficult to detect if the opponent does not have good night vision. Their Ingrain attack heals more health than usual, their draining attacks are more effective than normal and they gain greater benefit from both sun and rain than other Grass-types.</p>
<p>Cacturne (Grass/Dark): Cacturne are covered in spikes. Therefore, those who attack them with physical attacks will take roughly 25% recoil damage (unless they are particularly hard bodied) and their Needle Arm attack is more effective than normal. Being native to the desert where Sandstorms are frequent, Cacturne are immune to the effects of the attack and can see through them easily. They fight more enthusiastically in sandy or dusty areas. They are capable of standing very still, making them difficult to detect if the opponent does not have good night vision. Their Ingrain attack heals more health than usual, their draining attacks are more effective than normal and they gain greater benefit from both sun and rain than other Grass-types.</p>
<p>Camerupt (Fire/Ground): Camerupt tend to be only slightly-less apathetic than their Numel bretheren, although their higher intelligence gives them a better ability to follow orders. However, they become extremely angry when struck in the face. A Camerupt struck in the face by an opponent will focus almost exclusively on that target to the exclusion of all other concerns unless something else starts to become a bigger problem or gets in the way of Camerupts's revenge. Until its target has fallen Camerupt will be extremely emotional and responsive but more vulnerable to confusion. Camerupt will also be winded for a few moments after its berserker rage has ended, with longer periods of rage meaning more downtime. A trainer may write a note in their bio stating that their Camerupt has been trained not to enter in to the enraged state in this way. In its Mega Forme, Camerupt becomes an active volcano, constantly issuing lava. Its lava-based attacks are x1.2 stronger. Because of the intense heat radiated by Mega Camperupt, Water based attacks deal only half damage as they evaporate before they can affect it. They do not take extra Water damage for having an 'exposed flame'.</p>
<p>Carbink (Rock/Fairy): Carbink have bodies made of an extremely hard, diamond-like material, taking only 80% damage from physical attacks. However, while they can levitate, they are not particularly fast or agile. They also get a slight boost to light based attacks when fired from their head. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Carnivine (Grass): Carnivine can levitate, but have multiple vines that they can move around on, as well as extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack.Their bites and draining attacks are 10% more effective than normal and they naturally exude a scent that has effects similar to Sweet Scent at close range. As fly-traps, they are adapted to take slightly less damage from Bug and Poison moves and are resistant to being poisoned. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and other Carnivine are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. Their Ingrain technique is much more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Carracosta (Water/Rock): CarracostaÃ¢â�¬â�¢s shell is rock hard. Physical attacks targeted at it will be quite reduced in strength and super effective attacks against it deal slightly less damage. Although much more mobile than their preevolution on land, they are still somewhat sluggish and are a little bit slow in the water as well. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Carvanha (Water/Dark): Any Pok&#233;mon that strikes Carvanha with a physical attack will suffer 25% recoil damage from Carvanha's rough skin, unless their bodies are particularly hard. As a piranha, Carvanha's biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.1x more damage than usual. When Carvanha latches itself to something with its teeth, it is more difficult to shake or pry off. Carvanha are more effective in numbers. When battling alongside another fish Pok&#233;mon, they gain a boost in confidence that gives them a boost in attack. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Cascoon (Bug): Cascoon are almost completely immobile and move only when attacking. They move mostly by hopping and can latch on to trees and branches to stabilise themselves. Their Harden is much more effective than normal and they are slightly resistant to all attacks.</p>
<p>Castform (Normal): Castform change their shape, as well as their type, depending on the weather. They will become a Water-type while it's raining, a Fire-type during a Sunny Day and an Ice-type in Hail or Snow. Castform remain Normal during "normal" weather. Their weather changing attacks are much more powerful than normal, starting almost instantly at full power, lasting twice as long as usual and being much harder to change against Castform's wishes. They fight more enthusiastically in atypical weather conditions and their attacks are faster to charge in such environments. Castform levitate by default. </p>
<p>Caterpie (Bug): Caterpie, while not powerful Pok&#233;mon, have extremely sticky feet. If a throwing move dependent on the opponent's weight is used, they are considered to weigh 100 pounds for the duration of the attack if they are holding on to a surface.</p>
<p>Celebi (Grass/Psychic): Celebi is the only Pok&#233;mon known to be able to travel throughout the flow of time. Once per match, Celebi can literally "freeze time" around itself. While time is frozen, nothing moves or changes, with the exception of Celebi, who may move and attack. Celebi may also take allies into this frozen time pocket, though this is more stressful on Celebi and requires more energy. To observers outside the time pocket, Celebi and any in it seem to move faster than the speed of light, literally appearing and disappearing as they go. This allows it to perform moves almost instantaneously. The pocket will last for one round and cannot be entered unwillingly. This counts as one move, and requires significant energy to use.</p>
<p>Celesteela (Steel/Flying): Despite it's immense size, Celesteela is fairly fast, although it is not necessarily agile. It can fire beam like attacks from its two arms, making them fire somewhat faster although gaining no boost in damage. It has an immensely durable carapace, reducing incoming physical damage by 10%. Whenever Celesteela defeats an opponent, they gain a slight boost to their Special Attack.</p>
<p>Chandelure (Ghost/Fire): Chandelure's flames are made from a ghostly fire which only sheds light when it desires. Though this light can be used to illuminate dark spaces for long periods of time, it can also be turned off so that, despite still burning, it does not illuminate anything. Chandelure can levitate. Their arms, despite seeming solid, are actually relatively moveable and prehensile. Chandelure are generally solid, with the exception of their flame which counts as ethereal. They can phase temporarily into the ethereal state to lessen damage from moves. Chandelure's special attacks deal slightly more damage than those of other Pok&#233;mon. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Chansey (Normal): Chansey are resistant to special attacks and will take less damage from them. However, they are weak to physical attacks, and take more damage from them than normal. Their physical attack stat is also slightly weaker than normal. They are excellent healers and healing moves used to benefit other Pok&#233;mon will cost them slightly less energy than normal. They emanate a calming aura, being less vulnerable to anger-based attacks and calming all Pok&#233;mon on the field.</p>
<p>Charizard (Fire/Flying): Charizard are slow and cumbersome when on land but are able fliers. They are hot tempered and resistant to fear attacks. However, they are easily angered and confused. They have flaming tails, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. Charizard have slightly more Dragon energy than other Fire-types and, as starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health. Charizard is unique in having two Mega Formes. In its X Forme, it becomes Fire/Dragon typed whilst still retaining the flight abilities it possessed as a Charizard. Against any Pok&#233;mon that would reasonably be afraid of Charizard X, its fear-inducing attacks are more effective, and it becomes much more physical, giving attacks used with it's claws a 20% boost. Its Y Forme is slightly smaller and lighter than the X Forme, and is a nearly unparalleled fast and agile flier, able to fly with the speed and agility of a Pidgeot. Its powerful wings also grant it a 20% boost to wind moves. It also benefits greatly from the sun, the heat from its body causing sun to last two turns longer than normal.</p>
<p>Charjabug (Bug/Electric): Charjabug has a powerful jaw, which it can use for digging. Its biting attacks are 10% stronger than normal. It holds a constant Charge, making its Electrical attacks slightly faster and more powerful than average. Using a move, they can discharge some of this pent up energy, giving allies a boost to their Special Attack.</p>
<p>Charmander (Fire): Charmander are the most agile of their family on the ground. They have flaming tails, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Charmeleon (Fire): Charmeleon are the fastest of their line on the ground, though not as agile as their previous stage. They are harder to scare, but are more easily angered or confused. They have flaming tails, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Chatot (Normal/Flying): Chatot's sound-based attacks are more effective than normal and those that deal damage are 1.2x more powerful. Chatot can mimic the voice of a target's trainer or the call of another Pok&#233;mon on the field and are adept at throwing its voice. These skills can be used to distract and momentarily confuse foes at the cost of a move, being more effective if the foe cannot see Chatot at the time.</p>
<p>Cherrim (Grass): Cherrim have two forms, Sunny form, during Sunny weather, and Overcast form (considered the default), during all other weather. When the arena is under the effect of Sunny Day, Cherrim automatically blossom and fight much more enthusiastically. In addition to the normal effects of Sunny Day, Cherrim also gain a general boost to their special attack. In double battles, this excess energy acts like a lasting Helping Hand, also giving the Pok&#233;mon's partner a slight boost in Special Attack power.</p>
<p>Cherubi (Grass): Once a battle, using a move, Cherubi can absorb nutrients from the smaller cherry, restoring a good amount of health. They fight more enthusiastically in the sun.</p>
<p>Chesnaught (Grass/Fighting): Chesnaught's bodies are covered by an extremely durable wooden carapace, allowing them to guard themselves from physical assaults. Any physical attack that hits their shield or arm guards will deal only 80% damage. Additionally, their shell grants them extra protection against concussive force and any move involving bursting or explosions that hits their shell will be greatly reduced in damage. They have two vines hidden on their heads that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Chespin (Grass): Chespin's heads are covered in a firm but flexible layer of woody material, giving them a slight boost to defense for attacks that hit their head. They also can harden their head temporarily to give a slight boost to headbutting moves. They have two vines hidden on their heads that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Chikorita (Grass): A sweet smell emanates from Chikorita and all Pok&#233;mon within a foot of them have their attack and defense lowered slightly by it for as long as they can smell it. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon are unaffected as are members of the Chikorita line. Chikorita have two vines that extend from the seeds on their neck, allowing them to mainpulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Chimchar (Fire): Chimchar have flames on their back. These only go out when sleeping and can be used for illumination and to burn the foe if there is prolonged contact. They will increase and decrease in size depending on the intensity of the battle, with the flames growing as the situation goes dire. Chimchar are extremely good climbers, allowing them to scale most walls and surfaces and swing from vines and branches with ease. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Chimecho (Psychic): Chimecho levitate by default. They can use the suction cup on their head to attach themselves to surfaces. If a throwing move dependent on Chimecho's weight is used while attached, they are considered to weigh 100 pounds for the duration of the attack. Using a move, they can produce a shrill sound that can distract or shock the foe. Their sound attacks are slightly more powerful and effective than normal. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Chinchou (Water/Electric): Chinchou are fish and thus are slow and nearly immobile on land, but are faster and more agile in the water. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. Whenever a Chinchou uses an electric attack in the water, it creates a small amount of electricity around it, shocking anything in the water with it within 10 feet of it (damage is considered equal to half a Thunder Shock for the most powerful electric attacks. They may also use their antenna as a light source in the same way that the Mareep family does with their tails.</p>
<p>Chingling (Psychic): Chingling move primarily by bouncing, ringing lightly with every jump. Using a move, Chingling can produce a shrill sound that can distract or shock the foe. Their sound attacks are slightly more powerful and effective than normal. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Cinccino (Normal): Cinccino are very concerned with cleanliness and get quite annoyed when dirty. When attacked by 'dirty' moves (e.g. Mud Bomb), they will become annoyed and gain a slight boost to their attack power but have a slight chance of disobeying attacks in order to clean themselves. Their tufty fur makes them resistant to spore based moves and is sufficiently anti static to deflect weak Electric moves like Thunder Wave. Chained moves like Double Slap will be faster and more powerful when used by this Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Clamperl (Water): Clamperl lack legs, so their movement on land consists of hopping about a foot at a time. While swimming, Clamperl open and close their shell to move through the water. A Clamperl's shell is hard, reducing the damage from all attacks. The most vulnerable spot of a Clamperl is the face, where they will take a little more damage than usual. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Clauncher (Water): Clauncher's large claws act much like a cannon, granting a 10% boost to any moves fired from it. Though only decent swimmers, they can also use the exhaust from their claw to propel themselves on land and in water. They prefer to walk along the bottom of the water. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Clawitzer (Water): Clawitzer's large claws act much like a cannon, granting a 20% boost to any moves fired from it. Though only decent swimmers, they can also use the exhaust from their claw to propel themselves on land and in water. They prefer to walk along the bottom of the water. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Claydol (Ground/Psychic): As they have eyes all around their heads, Claydol are almost impossible to surprise or sneak up on. They have spherical arms that are capable of firing beam attacks. These arms are not attached to Claydol's body and can be separated out a foot or so, allowing them to attack from unexpected angles. As living dreidels, techniques which focus on spinning will be quicker to use and more effective than normal when used by Claydol. They levitate by default and are inorganic.</p>
<p>Clefable (Fairy): Clefable are a bit reclusive and naturally shy, so they donÃ¢â�¬â�¢t fight enthusiastically around large amounts of people and are easily intimidated. Clefable can jump high and far and can levitate, though not with much speed or agility. They can see in the dark. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Clefairy (Fairy): Clefairy are less shy than Clefable but are still unnerved by large crowds of people and are easy to intimidate. Clefairy can jump high and far and can levitate, though not with much speed or agility. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Cleffa (Fairy): Cleffa lack the shyness of their higher evolutions. They can see in the dark. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Cloyster (Water/Ice): Cloyster lack legs, so their movement on land consists of hopping a few feet at a time. While swimming, Cloyster open and close their shell to move through the water. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. A Cloyster's shell is hard, reducing the damage from all attacks. The most vulnerable spot of a Cloyster is its face, where it will take a little more damage than usual. They can see in the dark. Their Icicle Spear, Spike Cannon and Rock Blast attacks are slightly more powerful than usual, creating a greater number of projectiles and firing them with greater precision and accuracy.</p>
<p>Cobalion (Steel/Fighting): The leader of the Swords of Justice, Cobalion is a powerful and imposing fighter. Its steely demeanor makes it impossible to scare or intimidate and it remains calm in any situation, making it resistant to mind altering attacks and leaving smaller or more timid Pokémon feeling uncomfortable in its presence. Cobalion's Roar attack commands the attention of its foe, no matter the size or state of mind, leaving any opponent caught off guard by the sound. Its skin, despite being soft to the touch, is strangely hard, granting it a slight resistance against physical moves. Its Sacred Sword technique is 20% more powerful than average.</p>
<p>Cofagrigus (Ghost): Cofagrigus are composed of minerals and gold in the shape of a coffin which they have possessed, residing within this solid form. Though unable to change forms like other ghosts due to being bound to the coffin, they can close themselves within the coffin, taking 50% damage from all attacks whilst in this state. Their four "hands" move wildly and erratically but have no real substance, staying in the ethereal state by default. They can make their arms solid for short periods of time. They levitate by default. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Combee (Bug/Flying): Only female Combee can evolve. They have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Multiple Beedrill, Combee and Vespiquen on the same side share a hive mind, meaning that one cannot be surprised unless they all are and one cannot be affected mentally unless they all are. Their attacks also become more coordinated, making it harder for the foe to dodge combination attacks.</p>
<p>Combusken (Fire/Fighting): Combusken have very powerful legs. They can jump over twice their head height and their kicking attacks are slightly more powerful than normal. They are also familiar with the Flying type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Comfey (Fairy): Comfey carries around a lei that it has made from flowers it has scavenged. These flowers secrete oils that can be used effectively as salves and cure-alls, making healing moves more potent and effective. Healing moves used by Comfey will be more effective and will also activate much faster than normal. Comfey moves primarily by levitating, and while not exceptionally fast or agile, it can move with decent ability. The flowers also allow Comfey to use Grass moves as if they were a Grass-type.</p>
<p>Conkeldurr (Fighting): Conkeldurr carry around two concrete blocks which can be used in Physical attacks involving smashing the foe. Using them this way grants them 1.2x boost for an equivalent increase in energy use and a drop in speed. They are relatively deft with their weapon, able to nimbly wield it for attack and defense. The blocks can be dropped by Conkeldurr to execute an attack under normal conditions and can be stolen from it, though they are extremely heavy and any thief must be very strong to do so.</p>
<p>Corphish (Water): Corphish are highly aggressive and territorial and are thus susceptible to anger inducing moves. They will act more enthusiastically when using any offensive technique and less enthusiastically when using any defensive technique. Corphish can swim, but prefers to walk along the bottom of the water instead of swim in it. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Corsola (Water/Rock): Corsola have limited movement ability on land and are better suited to shallow water, where they can move more quickly with the water carrying some of their weight. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. Corsola are fairly resistant to Water-type moves despite their Rock-type and take slightly less damage from them. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Cosmoem (Psychic): Cosmoem has become almost completely dormant, it's slumbering mental state leaving it entirely immune to status of that kind. It's hardened exterior means it takes 20% less damage from all attacks. Its Teleport attack is near instantaneous and can cover a much wider distance than normal. Their passive nature leaves them unable to be afflicted by Taunt or Swagger.</p>
<p>Cosmog (Psychic): Cosmog is incredibly small and light, being able to be thrown about by even light gusts. However, the awkward composition of its body means all attacks, even energy based ones, will partially phase through, dealing 20% less damage. Its Teleport attack is near instantaneous and can cover a much wider distance than normal. Their passive nature leaves them unable to be afflicted by Taunt or Swagger.</p>
<p>Cottonee (Grass/Fairy): Cottonee are very light and fluffy and have a body which allows them to be picked up by the wind, allowing them to ride wind currents. When attacked, they release a light puff of cotton, which may cause light symptoms similar to the effects of Cotton Spore. Their Cotton Spore and Cotton Guard attacks are slightly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Crabominable (Fighting/Ice): Crabominable have incredibly powerful arms, granting them a 20% boost to punching attacks. They may use their arms as a rocket to use physical moves at distance, but this will take a round to regrow. Their sturdy carapaces will reduce physical damage by 10%.</p>
<p>Crabrawler (Fighting): Crabrawler constantly holds a guard when not attacking, reducing incoming physical damage by 10%. In addition, their punching moves are slightly faster than normal while dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Cradily (Rock/Grass): Cradily can stick to the ground to absorb nutrients. Lifting or trying to move this Pok&#233;mon will count as it having double weight. Cradily's Ingrain is more effective than normal. While they are capable of movement when not rooted down, they are quite slow, as they must hop around to get around. As a sea lily, their natural habitat is the ocean, allowing them to stay underwater indefinitely. They also take slightly less damage from Water-type attacks. They are capable of seeing in the dark. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Cranidos (Rock): Cranidos' extremely hard and somewhat pointed skull gives them a 1.1x boost in head-based attacks. However, Cranidos are neither fast nor agile. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Crawdaunt (Water/Dark): Crawdaunt are highly aggressive and territorial and are thus susceptible to anger inducing moves. They will act more enthusiastically when using any offensive technique and less enthusiastically when using any defensive technique. Crawdaunt can swim, but prefer to walk along the bottom of the water instead of swim in it. Their claw attacks are 1.2x stronger than normal.</p>
<p>Cresselia (Psychic): Cresselia is the embodiment of the full moon. They levitate naturally, and are rather fast and agile. Cresselia fight more enthusiastically at night. They are also extremely resistant to sleep, and will rarely do so against their will. Moonlight and Moonblast will be 20% more potent and can be used without using Fairy energy. Cresselia may also use Solar Beam using moonlight.</p>
<p>Croagunk (Poison/Fighting): Croagunk have sacs in their mouths that store toxins. Utilizing these stored poisons, Poison attacks from the mouth take slightly less energy. Being frogs, their powerful legs allow them to move quicker than most Pok&#233;mon in shorts bursts.</p>
<p>Crobat (Poison/Flying): Crobat are silent fliers and only Pok&#233;mon with excellent hearing will be able to hear them. Unlike Zubat, they can see, though they can use sonar if needed. Their individually controlled wings allow them incredible agility in the air, as well as impressive speed. They can see in the dark and have sensitive hearing, at the expense of increased vulnerability to sound based status attacks, though they are immune to confusion from Supersonic. Draining attacks used by Crobat drain faster than those used by other Pok&#233;mon if they are administered via a bite. They fight more enthusiastically at night.</p>
<p>Croconaw (Water): Croconaw are the average in terms of speed and agility for their family. As alligator Pok&#233;mon, their biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful than normal. However, their jaw muscles are meant for clamping down, not opening up, so most Pok&#233;mon can easily keep them shut with their own hands. In wet arenas, the airholes on their snouts allow them to stay almost completely submerged while being able to see above the surface. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Crustle (Bug/Rock): With a heavy shell of rock on their back, Crustle are a slow-moving Pok&#233;mon, having difficulty moving at much more than a fast crawl. However, Crustle's shell is extremely hard and durable, granting a boost in physical defense, though their vulnerable body will still take full damage. Using a move, they can spit acid that affects rocks. This can either weaken incoming Rock-type attacks, reducing them in power by a small amount, or target opposing Rock Pok&#233;mon for the same effects as Acid Spray on organic Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Cryogonal (Ice): Cryogonal levitate by default. The chain of ice produced from their face can be lengthened and shortened at will for slight energy cost and also used to manipulate items or foes. Moves like Light Screen and Reflect are stronger and faster to set up when used by Cryogonal. Cryogonal's Attract and similar moves show the target an image that they would find alluring. This works on male and female Pok&#233;mon. They are inorganic. Their icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind.</p>
<p>Cubchoo (Ice): Cubchoo constantly have a droplet of frozen water hanging from their nose, which they use to power their attacks. If submerged in water or otherwise added to, Cubchoo will gain a slight boost in their next Ice or Water attack. Techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective when used by Cubchoo. They are adept swimmers and can see in the dark</p>
<p>Cubone (Ground): A Cubone's face is covered by a skull, which it will not remove willingly. Cubone may not use its respective bone attacks if it is not holding its bone, but to compensate attacks using their bone will deal x1.1 damage due to the hardness of the weapon. Its Skull Bash attack takes slightly less energy than normal to use. Cubone can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Cutiefly (Bug/Fairy): Cutiefly are very small Pok&#233;mon, both some of the smallest and lightest Pok&#233;mon in existence. As such, their physical attacks are somewhat weakened. However, they are agile and fairly fast for their size, able to avoid attacks with greater ease. They are also highly sensitive to the energies and auras of other Pok&#233;mon, giving them a constant ability to detect the presence and location of their foes. Due to spending so much time around flowers, their Sweet Scent attack is much more potent, inducing a more profound slowed reaction in the opponent.</p>
<p>Cyndaquil (Fire): Cyndaquil are the most agile of their evolutionary family but are not the fastest. They can control whether their dorsal flames are ignited at any one time. When not ignited, they take only x1.5 damage from Water attack. However, they cannot use any fire attacks if their fire is not ignited. Igniting gives them their normal weakness to water and allows them to provide illumination and burn foes if there is prolonged contact. It also allows them to use fire attacks. Igniting does not count as a move, and happens automatically when the Pok&#233;mon is ordered a fire attack. However, de-igniting counts as a move. They will automatically de-ignite if they fall asleep. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Darkrai (Dark): Darkrai is the embodiment of nightmares. As such, any Pok&#233;mon asleep in the presence of Darkrai will suffer from Nightmare automatically. Darkrai naturally floats about a foot off the ground, but can reach about 8 feet without much effort and can levitate higher by expending light energy each round. It levitates with relative speed and agility. Although normally hidden, Darkrai does have legs which it can extend at will.</p>
<p>Darmanitan (Fire): Darmanitan's eyebrows are actually two flickering flames that grow more intense the more excited they are. They can be used to burn the foe if there is prolonged contact and for illumination. Being particularly energetic and fuelled by internal fire, their Fire-type attacks are used more quickly than usual and they are resistant to cold temperatures and freezing. Their powerful forelimbs give a x1.2 boost to all attacks performed with them. When they reach half health, the trainer may order Darmatian to go into Zen Mode, in which they withdraw their hands and legs and extinguish their external fire. In Zen Mode, Darmanitan gain a secondary Psychic-type and all associated weaknesses and resistances. Though immobile, Darmatian levitate in this mode. They may also still use physical attacks, though they will be somewhat reduced in power. When entering Zen Mode, they cannot come out of it until they faint.</p>
<p>Dartrix (Grass/Flying): As owls, the Rowlet line are the quietest fliers amongst Pok&#233;mon, almost inaudible as they fly. Dartrix can see in the dark, but fight with equal enthusiasm at all times of day. They can rotate their heads 180 degrees around, allowing them to see in all directions. They use their leaf-like feathers like darts, which they issue from their wings. It has a great deal of control over these feathers, and can bend them to take arching trajectories, which increases their accuracy with leaf-based moves. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Darumaka (Fire): Darumaka can curl up and sit completely immobile, mimicking a daruma. They will curl up like this when asleep or hiding. Being particularly energetic and fuelled by internal fire, their Fire-type attacks are used more quickly than usual and they are resistant to cold temperatures and freezing.</p>
<p>Decidueye (Grass/Ghost): As owls, the Rowlet line are the quietest fliers amongst Pok&#233;mon, almost inaudible as they fly. Dartrix can see in the dark, but fight with equal enthusiasm at all times of day. They can rotate their heads 180 degrees around, allowing them to see in all directions. They use their leaf-like feathers like arrows, which they issue from their wings. It has a great deal of control over these feathers, and can bend them to take arching trajectories, which increases their accuracy with leaf-based moves, and they are able to fire contact Grass moves as projectiles in this manner. Their bodies are almost entirely solid as Ghost Pokemon, though they can achieve the ethereal state for a few seconds, and they can be poisoned. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Dedenne (Electric/Fairy): Dedenne are rather fast and agile, able to squeeze into small spaces and climb well. The antennae on their cheeks allow them to communicate with other Electric-types, allowing them to more easily coordinate attacks or to read the moves of other Electric Pok&#233;mon. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Their cute and cheery disposition will cause opposing Pok&#233;mon to reconsider attacking them, much like a passive Charm effect. In addition, their Nuzzle attack uses less energy than normal.</p>
<p>Deerling (Normal/Grass): Deerling's appearance changes with the seasons, their body changing to Pink in the Spring, Green in the Summer, Orange in the Autumn, and Brown in the Winter (this form can be determined by the user, but some environments that are clearly "wintry" or "summery" may trigger this change). Deerling are especially cute and adorable, much like baby Pok&#233;mon, and are thus better at using techniques like Charm. Being so intrinsically linked with the natural world means that their Natural Gift attack will deal slightly more damage than normal, and will be less subject to diminishing returns than normal.</p>
<p>Deino (Dark/Dragon): Deino are blind, but due to this, are in a constant state of confusion and rage. This makes their attacks less accurate but as if powered permanently by a Howl. They do still have some perception of their world, though, able to hear and smell foes, and possibly sense their movement.</p>
<p>Delcatty (Normal): Techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective when used by Delcatty. They prefer to use their tail for slapping and similar attacks. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As a cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Delibird (Ice/Flying): Delibird are used to frigid temperatures and have a warm down similar to penguins, meaning that they are very skilled at flying through Blizzards and high wind. They can also swim reasonably well and hold their breath as long as a Water type. They can see in the dark. Delibird may carry items in their sacks, as long as the items are reasonable (i.e. no halberds), but a Delibird may not bring an item in its sack into battle unless the item is part of its sig move. They have control over the effect level of their Present attack and can choose the damage (from light to heavy) as well as choosing to have it heal up to a significant amount of health. Delibird may heal a team mate in this way, and it will not count as a healing move, but this may only be done once. They are highly resistant to sleep inducing moves and will regenerate energy twice as quickly when using Rest.</p>
<p>Delphox (Fire/Psychic): Delphox are adept pyrokinetics, allowing them to freely manipulate their Fire attacks. Using light energy for each action, they may redirect their Fire attacks to circumvent obstacles or chase down a moving target, but more than two actions per move will be counted as a move. Using a move, Delphox can be ordered to draw the twig from their tail, lighting it. They can use this twig as a light source or to direct their Fire attacks, or possibly as a source for their moves (at the cost of light energy). However, if the twig is stolen or extinguished, they will be unable to direct their Fire attacks and will have to relight it using a Fire move or by lighting it with their tail again. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Deoxys (Psychic): Deoxys is an alien being created from the energy from a powerful blast of energy. Deoxys can change between four different Formes, each with their own unique abilities. All four Formes share the ability to levitate with flight-like ability, though speed and agility varies depending on the Forme. The Normal Forme is the most balanced of the four, having decent speed in the air and having relatively balanced attack and defense. It is able to transform its arms into two tentacles for each arm, allowing it to use them to ensnare foes or manipulate them with them. The Attack Forme is focused entirely on offense at the expense of defense. All its attacks do 20% more damage, but all attacks it takes in this Forme do 20% more damage as well. Attack Forme is the second fastest, only somewhat slower than Speed. Although it lacks hands or arms, it can use its whip-like tentacles to execute attacks that require them. The Defense Forme is focused on defense at the expense of offense. All attacks do 20% less damage to Defense Forme Deoxys, but all its attacks do 20% less damage as well. Defense Forme is also slower in the air, flying about at the speed of a Magnezone. Its block-like appendages can be used for arm and hand-based physical attacks. Its defensive techniques require 10% less energy. The Speed Forme is rather middling in both defense and offense, but is blindingly fast, moving faster than any other Pok&#233;mon, to the point where it appears to teleport with each movement. Like the other formes, its whip-like appendages can be used for physical attacks. Deoxys may switch Formes once per round, using a move. </p>
<p>Dewgong (Water/Ice): Dewgong can move on land but, being slow and awkward, they prefer to swim if they can. If the floor is slippery like an Ice field, Dewgong can manoeuvre easily using its flippers and tail. They are also very agile swimmers. Dewgong are highly resistant to freezing temperatures and remain nimble in the coldest waters where other Pok&#233;mon might be numbed. They can easily conceal itself in snowy and icy environments. They can see in the dark. The horn atop their head will cause ramming attacks to deal slightly more damage.</p>
<p>Dewott (Water): Dewott wield two sharp shells, much like their preevolution, generally only wielding one at a time Oshawott constantly wield a shell which they use as a weapon, performing slashing attacks with it, and their Razor Shell attack is 1.1x more powerful than usual. The shells are fairly solid and can be used to defend against many physical attacks or to counter some attacks. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Dewpider (Water/Bug): Dewpider are adept both on land and in water, being able to propel themselves with their bubble when submerged. Their Water type attacks are amplified by the watery bubble surrounding their body, dealing an additional 10% damage. In addition, this barrier will slightly reduce the power of incoming Fire moves.</p>
<p>Dhelmise (Ghost/Grass): Dhelmise are actually possessed seaweed, but their intrinsic connection to the anchor they hold means they will still suffer damage normally should the anchor be stricken. They are familiar with the Steel type, and all their Steel type moves will deal slightly more damage. Dhelmise are almost entirely solid, but can go ethereal for short periods of time. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Dialga (Steel/Dragon): Dialga is the embodiment of time. As such, it has control over the flow of time. Once per match, Dialga can literally "freeze time" around itself. While time is frozen, nothing moves or changes, with the exception of Dialga, who may move and attack. Dialga may also take allies into this frozen time pocket, though this is more stressful on Dialga and requires more energy. To observers outside the time pocket, Dialga and any in it seem to move faster than the speed of light, literally appearing and disappearing as they go. This allows it to perform moves almost instantaneously. The pocket will last for one round and cannot be entered unwillfully. This counts as one move, and requires significant energy to use. It may also slow time around it using a move and significant energy, allowing it more time to react to moves, or speed time up around it, allowing it to move faster. Dialga has some powers of flight, and while not particularly nimble, it is relatively fast. They also are able to shift between dimensions for a short time using a move, allowing them to go effectively invisible for about a round.</p>
<p>Diancie (Rock/Fairy): A mutation of Carbink, Diancie shares many features with Carbink. Diancie have bodies made of an extremely hard, diamond-like material, taking only 80% damage from physical attacks. However, while they can levitate, they are not particularly fast or agile, though they are slightly more agile than Carbink. They also get a slight boost to light based attacks when fired from their head. They are inorganic. They are able to construct diamond structures by fusing carbon in the air, creating protective structures that will defend against most attacks but cannot be easily manipulated. In its Mega Forme, Diancie becomes a shimmering image, transforming into the Royal Pink Princess. Diancie is extremely resplendent, boosting her light-based moves by 10%. All her Rock moves will be formed from diamond, making them slightly harder and allowing them to penetrate screens and other moves more easily, as well as doing slightly more damage. She can create a "sword" of diamond that it can use for physical moves.</p>
<p>Diggersby (Normal/Ground): Diggersby's extremely powerful ears allow them to dig at a rapid pace and break through hard stone and tough ground as easily as if it were loamy soil. These powerful ears will also grant a slight boost in power to all attacks using them. All of their Digging-related moves will use much less energy than the average Pok&#233;mon. As a rabbit Pok&#233;mon, they are slightly more adept at bouncing than running, and can bridge large distances more easier with hops than dashing.</p>
<p>Diglett (Ground): Anatomically, with the exception of the head, a Diglett looks almost exactly like a mole. While Diglett can fight on the ground, they prefer not to, as they are more comfortable with digging. If on ground they can't Dig, however, they will stand above it. Diglett can quickly duck back into their hole to dodge an attack if ordered to do so, provided that they see the attack coming. However, doing so makes them vulnerable to special attacks and water being blasted down their hole. Diglett can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Diglett [Alola] (Ground/Steel): Alolan Diglett looks almost identical to wild Diglett, with the main difference being the protruding strands of golden hair atop their head. These allow them to locate Pokemon even while they are underground, giving them a profound field of view. While Diglett can fight on the ground, they prefer not to, as they are more comfortable with digging. If on ground they can't Dig, however, they will stand above it. Diglett can quickly duck back into their hole to dodge an attack if ordered to do so, provided that they see the attack coming. However, doing so makes them vulnerable to special attacks and water being blasted down their hole. Diglett can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Ditto (Normal): Ditto are very malleable and flexible, able to Transform with great ease and speed. They can also squeeze through gaps that other Pok&#233;mon would find impossible when in their natural form. Their flexibility extends to energy and they start battle with one hyper beam's worth of type energy from every Pok&#233;mon type. The first time which a Ditto transforms in to a Pok&#233;mon, it gains an additional hyper beam's worth of energy for each of the target's natural types. Subsequent transformations will have the same effect, but will only provide half as much energy as the previous transformation. The first transformation Ditto carries out does not count as a move, though it still takes the usual amount of time to execute. A Ditto may disguise itself as an inanimate object in the arena with its Transform attack. This requires less energy than a normal Transform and a Ditto is almost impossible to tell apart from the object it's copying. Ditto, however, cannot copy complicated mechanisms or things with complicated moving parts accurately (thus, if it were to copy a Pok&#233;ball, it wouldn't be able to use a Pok&#233;ball's buffer scan/recall beam).</p>
<p>Dodrio (Normal/Flying): The heads of a Dodrio share a hive mind of sorts. One head cannot be surprised or snuck up on unless the others are. When Resting, one head remains awake, which means that a Dodrio cannot be dealt a critical hit while using Rest (sleep induced by other means, such as through an attack, will put all 3 heads to sleep and make Dodrio vulnerable to a critical hit). Either of their heads heads can be used to attack at any time, both physically and specially, and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal. They also receive a 1.2x boost to attacks made using their beaks. Dodrio and Doduo cannot fly, but they have exceptional jumping ability and are fast runners, enabling them to use attacks like Fly by leaping in order to evade attacks and striking their foes moments later.</p>
<p>Doduo (Normal/Flying): The heads of a Doduo share a hive mind of sorts. One head cannot be surprised or snuck up on unless the other is. When Resting, one head remains awake, which means that a Doduo cannot be dealt a critical hit while using Rest (sleep induced by other means, such as through an attack, will put both heads to sleep and make Doduo vulnerable to a critical hit). Either of their heads heads can be used to attack at any time, both physically and specially, and they receive a 1.1x boost to attacks made using their beaks. Dodrio and Doduo cannot fly, but they have exceptional jumping ability and are fast runners, enabling them to use attacks like Fly by leaping in order to evade attacks and striking their foes moments later. </p>
<p>Donphan (Ground): The strip of black, leathery skin acts as treads for when performing a Rollout, thus giving better traction (and accuracy) when using a Rollout attack. Like all elephants, Donphan are sure-footed, even though they cannot see their own feet.</p>
<p>Doublade (Steel/Ghost): Doublade are two possessed swords, their body entirely made up of the blades and aegis, making them inorganic. All attacks involving slashing get a 20% boost in power. They levitate by default. They always grip their aegis with one of their cloths, somewhat weighted down by the heavy metal protector. Their other cloth can be used to grip some objects but it is not very prehensile and its grip is easy to break. As Doublade is made up of two separate swords, they are able to perform two slashing attacks in quick succession without the normal restrictions of combos and without using additional energy. Using a move, Doublade can sheath themselves, making them unable to use slashing attacks but meaning they take only 80% damage from attacks. As they are bound to a physical object, they are can only achieve ethereal for a short time using light energy. They can also become invisible, but their sheath will not be affected.</p>
<p>Dragalge (Poison/Dragon): Though not a Water-type, Dragalge are adept and graceful swimmers, able to stay underwater indefinitely. They are considered familiar with the Water type. Although they are far better swimmers than their preevolution, they are also able to camouflage themselves as rotting kelp if needed. The poisonous fluids secreted by Dragalge are tinged with acid, making all poison attacks have a slight corrosive effect, similar to but not as potent as Acid Spray.</p>
<p>Dragonair (Dragon): Dragonair can levitate and have a higher flight ceiling than most Pok&#233;mon. They are more agile than they are fast. They can also move in the same way as Dratini and are excellent swimmers. Sunny Day or Rain Dance will last one round longer than normal if used by a Dragonair. They have decent vision in low light environments.</p>
<p>Dragonite (Dragon/Flying): Despite their short wings, Dragonite can fly well. However, they are more speed fliers than finesse fliers and need a good distance to turn at high speeds. On the ground and in the water, they can move and dodge at a decent speed. They have decent vision in low light environments. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Drampa (Normal/Dragon): Drampa is typically a very calm and gentle Pok&#233;mon, making it difficult to enrage. However, they are quite protective of their friends and can be angered by aggression in battle. If its ally hits critical health, it will gain a significant boost to its Special Attack. If it drops below half health, it will receive a similar, slightly less potent boost. Its Dragon Breath is slightly more powerful and also quite forceful, with the same force as a Blizzard.</p>
<p>Drapion (Poison/Dark): Drapion are able to rotate their head 360 degrees. They can extend their limbs to up to twice their length to hit distant targets or to increase their stride. They are adept at digging and can stay underground for longer than other non-Grounds. They are familiar with the Bug-type.</p>
<p>Dratini (Dragon): Dratini can move equally well in the water and on the ground, but they prefer water, as they cannot fly like their higher evolutions. They have decent vision in low light environments.</p>
<p>Drifblim (Ghost/Flying): Drifblim can inflate themselves to either provide a slight defense against physical attacks or for propulsion. Drifblim are almost always solid, but able to turn ethereal for short periods of time. They are very nimble in the air but light much like Hoppip and can be blown about easily by winds, but in ethereal, they are not influenced by winds or other similar forces. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Drifloon (Ghost/Flying): Drifloon can inflate themselves to either provide a slight defense against physical attacks or for propulsion. Drifloon are almost always solid, but able to turn ethereal for short periods of time.

They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Drilbur (Ground): Drilbur dig like a drill using their long, pointed, shovel-like claws. They can dig quickly and easily through almost any type of ground, even through some hard, typically impenetrable surfaces like concrete, though this will be more difficult and take more energy. Their tunnels are also sturdy, and, if desired, can be made so they do not collapse after being dug. Their claw based attacks deal 1.1x damage.</p>
<p>Drowzee (Psychic): Drowzee focus on sleep-related attacks. Their Hypnosis, Dream Eater, and Nightmare attacks are more powerful than normal and will take effect more quickly.</p>
<p>Druddigon (Dragon): Druddigon are very cold-blooded. In the sun and warmer temperatures, they will fight with great enthusiasm, but in cold temperatures or if chilled, they will quickly grow sluggish. Their skin is very tough and scaly and their body is covered in spikes; both of these factors will cause 25% recoil to physical attacks against it.</p>
<p>Ducklett (Water/Flying): Ducklett are only decent swimmers, able to stay underwater for a time but are not very mobile while underwater. Their physical defence is slightly higher than other bird Pok&#233;mon and cannot be lowered. They have exceptional eyesight and enhanced accuracy which is very difficult to lower. Owing to their reputation for being distance fliers, they tire slower than other Pok&#233;mon. In addition, their powerful wings give them a x1.1 boost to all moves involving them.</p>
<p>Dugtrio (Ground): Dugtrio share a linked mind, just like Dodrio do. Thus, a Dugtrio member cannot be surprised unless they all are. Any of the heads can be used to attack, both physically and specially, and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal. Anatomically, with the exception of the heads, a Dugtrio looks almost exactly like a group of moles. While Dugtrio can fight on the ground, they prefer not to, as they are more comfortable with digging. If on ground they can't Dig, however, they will stand above it. Dugtrio can quickly duck back into their hole to dodge an attack if ordered to do so, provided that they see the attack coming. However, doing so makes them vulnerable to special attacks and water being blasted down their hole. Dugtrio can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Dugtrio [Alola] (Ground/Steel): Alolan Dugtrio looks almost identical to wild Dugtrio, with the main difference being the golden hair atop their head This is particularly resilient having evolved, and will resist physical damage by 20%, as well as allowing them to locate Pokemon even while they are underground, giving them a profound field of view . Dugtrio share a linked mind, just like Dodrio do. Thus, a Dugtrio member cannot be surprised unless they all are. Any of the heads can be used to attack, both physically and specially, and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal.

Dugtrio can quickly duck back into their hole to dodge an attack if ordered to do so, provided that they see the attack coming. However, doing so makes them vulnerable to special attacks and water being blasted down their hole. Dugtrio can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Dunsparce (Normal): Dunsparce can see in the dark. When using attacks like Drill Run or Dig, they will travel backwards and use their tail to attack. Dunsparce are adept diggers and can stay underground as long as any Ground-type. A Dunsparce can also levitate with its wings, though neither fast nor well.</p>
<p>Duosion (Psychic): Duosion's body is surrounded by a liquid chemically similar in composition to a cell's cytoplasm, acting as a protective buffer from the outside environment. The damaging effects of weather, such as Hail or Sandstorm, will be buffered by this coating of liquid, and statuses, like poison or burn, may be weakened or distributed. Toxic will take an extra turn to set in as it diffuses through this liquid coat. With two brains, Duosion is also somewhat more resistant to mentally-effecting attacks. They levitate by default.</p>
<p>Durant (Bug/Steel): Durant are extremely adept diggers, able to form stable tunnels with ease. Due to their feud with Heatmor, they have developed a slight resistance to Fire. As Pok&#233;mon typically dwelling in colonies, they fight more enthusiastically in groups. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Dusclops (Ghost): Dusclops are relatively solid and prefer that state, but can go ethereal or invisible with little problem. Though they typically stay on the ground, they are able to levitate, but are not particularly fast or agile and possess a low flight ceiling. Their defense and special defense are slightly higher than those of other Ghosts. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Dusknoir (Ghost): Dusknoir are relatively solid and prefer that state, but can go ethereal or invisible with little problem. Unlike Duskull and Dusclops, they can levitate with decent speed and agility. Their defense and special defense are slightly higher than those of other Ghosts. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Duskull (Ghost): Though they can become solid or invisible, Duskull are nearly always ethereal. They levitate by default but have a lower flight ceiling than most levitating Pok&#233;mon. Though rather slow, they make up for this with a fantastic ability to hide, able to reside in walls and other solid objects for a little longer than other ghosts and able to pass through thicker walls. Their defense and special defense are slightly higher than those of other Ghosts. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Dustox (Bug/Poison): The scales of Dustox' wings are littered with toxic powders. As a result, any Pok&#233;mon which comes within a reasonable distance of Dustox will be inflicted with Poison should they breathe these powders in. They are familiar with the Psychic type. Being nocturnal, they fight more enthusiastically at night. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Dwebble (Bug/Rock): Dwebble's shell are actually a hollowed out rock. Their bodies are fairly small, allowing them to withdraw easily inside for defense. Though very rarely will they abandon their rock, they can do so in desperation or if otherwise required. Using a move, they can spit acid that affects rocks. This can either weaken incoming Rock-type attacks, reducing them in power by a small amount, or target opposing Rock Pok&#233;mon for the same effects as Acid Spray on organic Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Eelektrik (Electric): Eelektrik levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are much more agile. They are also fairly good swimmers and are able to stay underwater as long as any Water-type.</p>

Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Eevee's Trump Card and Last Resort attacks deal slightly more damage and have a slightly quicker charge time compared to most Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Ekans (Poison): Ekans can move very quietly. They may shake their rattles as an attack, intimidating targets that might be reasonably scared by a Pok&#233;mon twice their size. They can see in the dark and are good swimmers that can hold their breath longer than most Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Electabuzz (Electric): Electabuzz are able to recharge themselves more efficiently than other Electric types and, whenever they use only one attack in a round, they will automatically recover moderate energy at the end of the round. They are resistant to moves which induce sleep or drowsiness and will recover more quickly from these conditions.</p>
<p>Electivire (Electric): Electivire are able to use their tails to channel Electric attacks. Direct contact with the foe using its tails will give a slight boost in the chance of paralysis for the attack and will make paralysis in the contact area far more likely. If hit by an Electric attack, Electivire will experience a surge of power and gain a slight boost to its speed for about a round.

<p>Electrode (Electric): Electrode are able to levitate above the ground, although their flight ceiling is lower than other Pokemon. However, they make up for this with an impressive speed, being able to move quickly and agilely. Alternatively, they may choose to disengage their levitation and move by rolling, with their movement speed being dependent on the smoothness of the terrain. They are fastest on flat, smooth ground and slowest on rocky ground. On flat ground, they will outspeed almost any Pokémon. Engaging and disengaging levitation does not require a move. They have a 5% chance of Exploding when KOd. Electrode's Selfdestruct and Explosion attacks charge much faster than other Pokémon. They are inorganic and fight more enthusiastically in man made environments</p>

<p>Emolga (Electric/Flying): Emolga cannot actually 'fly', much like the Gligar family, instead gliding over the ground. They are adept climbers and very agile on the ground. While gliding, they gently discharge electricity, and any Pok&#233;mon coming into contact with them will suffer slight recoil. Due to their tendency to store excess electricity within their cheek pouches, their Charge attack is more potent than usual. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Empoleon (Water/Steel): Empoleon are very proud Pok&#233;mon and will not be discouraged easily.

<p>Entei (Fire): Entei is a rather adept runner on the ground, able to outrun most Pok&#233;mon. An Entei's Roar attack is more effective than normal. When an Entei is first sent out or appears, the weather (if applicable) is considered to automatically change to a Sunny Day for the usual amount of time (5 rounds).</p>
<p>Escavalier (Bug/Steel): Escavalier are covered in a thick, steely armor developed from the shell of a Shelmet. This provides some level of defense against physical attacks. Escavalier can levitate and reach high speeds, but have trouble turning. Moves using their 'lance' deal x1.2 damage. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Espeon (Psychic): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. An Espeon's fur is sensitive to the movements of the wind caused by the movements of an opponent, so it has a slightly higher chance of evading any attack from an opponent, and is very difficult to surprise. Their Future Sight attack costs slightly less energy to use compared to other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Espurr (Psychic): Espurr's Psychic abilities are somewhat underdeveloped, requiring slightly more focus than normal to execute Psychic attacks. Using a move, they can raise their ears to expose their telepathic organ, giving a slight boost to their Psychic attacks for a drop in accuracy. They can see in the dark and are well adapted to moving silently. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As cats, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed.</p>
<p>Excadrill (Ground/Steel): Excadrill's claws are as tough as steel and covered in sharp grooves, allowing them to dig through any surface with great ease. They dig like a drill, rotating extremely quickly, letting them travel very fast through the ground for little energy. They can dig through most surfaces and tunnel in almost anything even in solid concrete or bedrock, though this will be more difficult and require more energy. Their tunnels are also sturdy, and, if desired, can be made so they do not collapse after being dug. Their claw based attacks deal 1.2x damage.</p>
<p>Exeggcute (Grass/Psychic): Exeggcute share a linked mind: none can be surprised unless they all are. While individually weak, they display strong group tactics, and the healthiest one will take the hits for the weakest ones. An Exeggcute is considered knocked out when all its individual eggs are.</p>
<p>Exeggutor (Grass/Psychic): An Exeggutor literally has eyes everywhere: it is impossible to surprise from behind. They are capable of attacking an opponent with most of their attacks, no matter which direction they are 'facing'. For Rollout, Exeggutor will drop one of its 'heads' to attack. While the head is using a Rollout, Exeggutor loses the abilities of that particular head. When done with Rollout, the head will Teleport back to the Exeggutor and reconnect for minor energy. An Exeggutor is considered to be knocked out when its body is, as the heads will all faint when the body does. Exeggutor deals slightly more damage with its special Psychic and Grass moves than other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Exeggutor [Alola] (Grass/Dragon): Alolan Exeggutor are extremely tall. Their necks extend over 30 feet in the air. However, its trunk is quite flexible and it can use its neck as a whip. In addition to the three heads on its trunk, it also has a fourth head on its tail. This head controls the tail independently of the rest of the Pok&#233;mon's body, allowing it to perform two attacks simultaneously with both the body and the tail. This also makes it harder to put entirely to sleep. Despite having lost its Psychic typing, Alolan Exeggutor is still familiar with Psychic energy. An Exeggutor literally has eyes everywhere: it is impossible to surprise from behind, and with the increased height of Alolan Exeggutor and the additional head, it has an even greater line of sight. They are capable of attacking an opponent with most of their attacks, no matter which direction they are 'facing'. For Rollout, Exeggutor will drop one of its 'heads' to attack. While the head is using a Rollout, Exeggutor loses the abilities of that particular head. When done with Rollout, the head will Teleport back to the Exeggutor and reconnect for minor energy. An Exeggutor is considered to be knocked out when its body is, as the heads will all faint when the body does.</p>
<p>Exploud (Normal): Exploud have sensitive hearing but are unaffected by sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They still take damage from such moves where applicable. Their sound moves are significantly more potent, and can be used at standard potency even when spread. They can see in the dark. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Farfetch'd (Normal/Flying): Farfetch'd use their leek like a weapon. If they lose it, they will be unable to use Cut, Slash, or similar moves, but they are more skilled at using these moves than other Pok&#233;mon and will have a small boost in power and accuracy when using their leek. As duck Pok&#233;mon, Farfetch'd can float on top of the water and have a limited diving ability. They have exceptional eyesight and enhanced accuracy which is very difficult to lower.</p>
<p>Fearow (Normal/Flying): While not as agile as its previous evolution, the large wings of a Fearow make it faster and able to fly for longer. Attacks made using their beaks are 1.2x more powerful. They also uses less energy when carrying other Pok&#233;mon and can lift 1.5x the weight that most bird Pok&#233;mon can.</p>
<p>Feebas (Water): Feebas are considered very ugly, diminishing the strength of their Attract and similar techniques. They have learned to be agile swimmers and is good at hiding. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Fennekin (Fire): Fennekin are rather skilled in manipulating flames, able to redirect their Fire attacks slightly to move around obstacles or pursue moving targets for additional light energy. They are familiar with the Psychic type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Feraligatr (Water): While not as agile as their previous stages of the evolutionary line, Feraligatr are the fastest on land and in water. They will travel on all fours for extended distances. As alligator Pok&#233;mon, their biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful. However, their jaw muscles are meant for clamping down, not opening up, so most Pok&#233;mon can easily keep them shut with their own hands. In wet arenas, the airholes on their snouts allow them to stay almost completely submerged while being able to see above the surface. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Ferroseed (Grass/Steel): Ferroseed are covered in large spines. Physical attacks dealt to them will deal 25% recoil damage to the user. Ferroseed, though typically fairly sessile, can move by rolling, spinning or hopping if need be. Their Gyro Ball is more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Ferrothorn (Grass/Steel): Like their pre-evolution, Ferrothorn are covered in large spines. Physical attacks dealt to them will deal 25% recoil damage to the user. Ferrothorn move with the aid of their three vines, able to use them much like arms or claws to move or attack. They can also be used to stick to ceilings or other horizontal surfaces. Their Gyro Ball is more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Finneon (Water): As a butterfly fish, Finneon's wind attacks are more effective than normal. Finneon have more type energy than normal for all of their wind based attacks. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>

Flaaffy have the ability to use the balls on their tails as lights. While not as powerful as a Flash attack, they light up the arena without blinding opponents or allies, and doing so takes almost no energy to maintain. It is considered one move for a Flaaffy to light its tail. This will, however, make it a more obvious target for Pok&#233;mon who can see in dark areas.</p>
<p>Flab&#233;b&#233; (Fairy): Flab&#233;b&#233; are extremely small Pok&#233;mon, tied for both the lightest and smallest ever discovered. Flab&#233;b&#233; share a symbiotic relationship with their flower, which can come in a variety of colors. This flower generates a constant source of Grass energy, allowing them to use Grass moves as if it were a Grass-type. If Flab&#233;b&#233; are separated from their flower, they will lose the ability to use their Grass moves and will forego any orders in order to reunite with them. Flab&#233;b&#233; and their flower can levitate, but due to their extremely light weight, they will be easily moved about by slight gusts or winds. Due to their connection with plants and nature, they are subject to the effects of Flower Shield. They have two vines hidden in their flowers that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack.</p>
<p>Flareon (Fire): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Flareon may use a move to warm themselves, which grants a slight defensive boost against Water-type moves and can be used to thaw ice. Flareon's tackle-based attacks deal slightly more damage than those of the other Eeveelutions.</p>
<p>Fletchinder (Fire/Flying): Fletchinder propel themselves in the air using the flames that build in their chest. Though they cannot accelerate very quickly, they can build up very high speeds over time as their fire builds.</p>
<p>Fletchling (Normal/Flying): Fletchling are rather fast and nimble fliers, due to their relatively small size. They generates fire from a small heat sink it the center of their body, allowing them to use significantly more Fire attacks than the average Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Floatzel (Water): Floatzel use their tails similar to a propeller. This allows them to control their speed in the water and make sharp turns with great ease. They can rotate their tails like helicopter blades and levitate, though they are neither fast nor agile at this. The ring around their necks can be used as a floatation device, making them hard to force underwater. It may also be inflated and used as a shield, granting a small boost to physical defense. Floatzel are a good bit faster than the average Water-type on land.</p>
<p>Floette (Fairy): Floette share a symbiotic relationship with their flower, which can come in a variety of colors. This flower generates a constant source of Grass energy, allowing them to use Grass moves as if it were a Grass-type. If Floette are separated from their flower, they will lose the ability to use their Grass moves and will forego any orders in order to reunite with them. Though heavier and larger than Flab&#233;b&#233;, they are still relatively small and light and can levitate. Due to their connection with plants and nature, they are subject to the effects of Flower Shield. They have two vines hidden in their flowers that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack.</p>
<p>Florges (Fairy): Florges have physically merged with their flower, effectively becoming a single entity. This flower generates a constant source of energy, allowing them to use Grass moves as if they were a Grass-type. They can levitate. Due to their connection with plants and nature, they are subject to the effects of Flower Shield. They have two vines hidden in their flowers that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack.</p>
<p>Flygon (Ground/Dragon): Flygon are not as proficient at digging as their basic form but can still conceal themselves well within sandy environments and fight more enthusiastically in them. Flygon's shielded eyes are adapted to seeing in a sandstorm and such are not hindered in heavy sand or fog. Flygon can see in the dark and are resistant to light based attacks targeted at the eyes such as Flash. They are agile fliers, though not exceptionally fast, and are familiar with the Bug type. Because they flap their wings so quickly and produce a near ultrasonic but distracting noise, attacks which use their wings to strike have a 10% flinch chance against its targets.</p>
<p>Fomantis (Grass): Despite being a Grass Pok&#233;mon, Fomantis is largely nocturnal, preferring to spend its days absorbing sunlight and standing still. As such, it fights quite enthusiastically at night. Because it spends all day storing solar energy, it can use solar-based attacks in any conditions, including indoors, at night, and in the dark. However, using these moves in conditions where the sun is not present will wind it slightly more than average.</p>
<p>Foongus (Grass/Poison): When attacked physically or threatened, Foongus may release a small amount of spores causing a random mild status effect. Their spores and powders are somewhat more effective and spread in dense clouds. They are resistant to being afflicted with status moves.</p>
<p>Forretress (Bug/Steel): Forretress are almost completely covered by a hard, steely shell, reducing the damage from all attacks. The most vulnerable spot of a Forretress is its fleshy interior in the gap between its shell halves, where it will take a little more damage than usual. However, they are slowed by their bulk and move mostly by rolling. They can levitate as well, but are slow, not particularly agile and possess a lower flight ceiling than most levitating Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Fraxure (Dragon): Fraxure's tusks are tough and sharp. Any attacks utilizing these tusks are granted a 1.1x boost in power. Their fear inducing attacks are slightly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Frillish (Water/Ghost): Despite their resemblance to jellies, Frillish can actually survive outside of the water for long periods of time. However, they fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizable body of water. They can levitate, though they are not particularly fast or agile in the air. They are usually solid, but can go ethereal for short periods of time. If another Pok&#233;mon makes contact with them using a move, there is a 20% chance that that move will be disabled for a period of three rounds. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Froakie (Water): Froakie are relatively agile and quick, moving with ninja-like skills. The bubbles around their neck give them slight protection against attacks and allow them to quickly produce bubble-related attacks. Using a move they can throw a clump of bubbles from their cape, which can stun a target or stick to them to hinder their movement using mild energy. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Frogadier (Water): Frogadier are quite agile and able to scale and cling to horizontal and vertical surfaces for a short period of time. They have an extremely keen sense of aim, and are able to reliably hit targets with projectiles even at a significant distance. The bubbles around their neck give them a slight protection against attacks and allow them to quickly produce bubble-related attacks. Using a move they can throw a clump of bubbles from their cape, which can stun a target or stick to them to hinder their movement using mild energy. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Froslass (Ice/Ghost): Froslass are primarily solid, though they can go ethereal or invisible for decent periods of time. Froslass's invisibility is imperfect, always leaving an icy glimmer behind, but it allows them to still hide in dark areas and ice, snow and other white or lightly colored areas. They are adept at hiding in blizzards and can see through them easily. They can also levitate. Their Double Team functions better in Hail and will not be revealed by the hailstones passing through them. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Furfrou (Normal): Furfrou's fur is extremely soft and cushiony, acting as both insulation and giving them a slight defensive boost against physical attacks. Furfrou's fur is often styled in a number of colorful fashions, giving it a slight boost to visually-based moves (such as Attract or Charm) when groomed. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. As dogs they are quite good diggers and swimmers, though these activities will be unpleasant for them and ruin their style, and they deal 1.2x damage with their biting attacks.</p>
<p>Furret (Normal): A FurretÃ¢â�¬â�¢s body is long and extremely flexible. While neither the fastest nor the most agile, they are able to bend their bodies adequately to avoid attacks or get into areas that other Pok&#233;mon cannot. They are adept at escaping from holds and traps. They are also excellent at digging, able to burrow faster than most Pok&#233;mon. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Gabite (Dragon/Ground): Gabite are very quick when digging near the surface of the ground and will deal slightly more damage with Dig. They can see in the dark. Any Pok&#233;mon that strikes Gabite with a physical attack will suffer 25% recoil damage from their rough skin, unless their bodies are particularly hard. Their biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.1x more damage than usual. They are able to disguise themselves well in sandstorms and sandy arenas.</p>
<p>Gallade (Psychic/Fighting): Gallade are able to extend their arms and elbows. Their arms are also very sharp, and cutting attacks do slightly more damage. Their empathic abilities make Gallade very in touch with their opponent. Attacks that deal with the opponentÃ¢â�¬â�¢s mental state are more effective. They also has a very good sense of balance and are hard to knock down. Teleporting also requires slightly less energy. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, they are less proficient at maximising their use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy. In its Mega Form, Gallade becomes a dashing knight, sworn to defend its trainer. Its slashing moves become x1.2 more powerful. Due to its heightened concentration, it is far less vulnerable to mind-altering moves and cannot be flinched.</p>
<p>Galvantula (Bug/Electric): Galvantula are excellent climbers and can scale sheer surfaces. Much like Ariados, they are able to travel using their String Shot, which is slightly charged with electrical energy and can do slight electrical damage on contact, and will be more effective than usual.</p>
<p>Garbodor (Poison): As a living bag of trash, Garbodor emit a horrid stench. The more damage they take, the worse the smell becomes. Any Pok&#233;mon within five feet of them have a 20% chance of flinching and Pok&#233;mon within three feet will experience blurred vision and a slight reduction in attack and special attack. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Trubbish line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected.They can extend their limbs to up to twice their length to hit distant targets or to increase their stride. They thrive in environments where such poisons are abound. They are healed by toxic chemicals instead of harmed, and poison attacks heal them instead of harm them, though their own toxins will not heal them. They fight more enthusiastically in man made environments.</p>
<p>Garchomp (Dragon/Ground): Garchomp are capable of limited flight, though this is essentially high speed gliding. They can fly moderate distances and at a good height but are not very maneuverable in the air. They are also very quick when digging near the surface of the ground and will deal slightly more damage with Dig. They can see in the dark. Any Pok&#233;mon that strikes Garchomp with a physical attack will suffer 25% recoil damage from their rough skin, unless their bodies are particularly hard. Their biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.2x more damage than usual. They are able to disguise themselves well in sandstorms and sandy arenas. In its Mega Forme, Garchomp becomes an even more fearsome predator, sacrificing some speed for sheer offense. Its slashing moves are 20% more effective, and its other physical attacks are roughly 10% more effective.</p>
<p>Gardevoir (Psychic): Gardevoir's empathic abilities make them very in touch with them opponent. Attacks that deal with the opponents mental state are more effective. They also have a very good sense of balance and are hard to knock down. Teleporting also requires slightly less energy. In its Mega Forme, its empathic abilities are enhanced to the extent that it is largely impossible to fool through deceptive tactics such as Fake Tears and Feint Attack. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Fairy energy, causing them to become Fairy typed.</p>
<p>Gastly (Ghost/Poison): Gastly are essentially living gas and as such can only condense for a short time into a solid form to execute physical attacks. They are ethereal by default, but can become invisible for longer periods. When invisible, Gastly remain ethereal and do not enter a physical state. Gastly levitate by default, though they are not particularly fast or agile.</p>
<p>Gastrodon (Water/Ground): Gastrodon have two different forms, although they are not different from each other other then looks. Gastrodon move at a decent speed on land, and a respectable pace in the water, though they prefer shallow, slow water to deep, fast currents. They are coated with a slimy substance, which makes them harder to grab and prevents them from being affected by Electric attacks when wet. They are also able to stick to the ground. Any weight attack used against them will when stuck will have them considered to be double their weight. This stickiness also allows it to scale some vertical surfaces.</p>
<p>Genesect (Bug/Steel): Genesect is the result of a genetic experiment conducted by Team Plasma. Despite having no clear Forme of propulsion, Genesect is an extremely fast flyer, able to transform into its High-Speed Flight Form to move extremely fast through the air. It can only fly while in this form and though it generally moves extremely fast, it can control its speed reasonably well. It can also produce a sticky string from its claws which can be used much in the same way as String Shot. The cannon on its back can have various Drives installed, which modifies the type of its signature move, Techno Blast. Without a Drive installed, Techno Blast is Normal-typed, with the Burn Drive, it becomes Fire-typed, with the Douse Drive, it becomes Water-typed, with the Shock Drive, it becomes Electric-type, and with the Chill Drive, it becomes Ice-type.</p>
<p>Gengar (Ghost/Poison): Unlike its preevolutions, Gengar are primarily solid, though they are able to freely achieve all of the other states. A Gengar's Lick attack has a 50% chance to paralyze, instead of the usual 30%. Gengar can levitate and are fast and agile in the air. In its Mega Forme, Gengar becomes a being of pure malicious energy, greatly enhancing its abilities. Although it loses its ability to levitate, it becomes extremely fast and agile over the ground, floating just above the surface and able to move at high speeds. It is also gains an extra turn of invisibility and can change effortlessly between states. In its Mega Forme, Gengar tends to prefer ethereal, though it can easily change states.</p>
<p>Geodude (Rock/Ground): Geodude have the greatest variety of locomotion options amongst the Geodude family. They are capable of rolling, walking on their hands, or levitating, though they cannot hover very high and move quite slowly in this way. Geodude can see in the dark. Their Defense Curl will give them much more protection than most Pok&#233;mon. Geodude may disguise themselves as a normal boulder by rolling up, an effective hiding method against many Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Geodude [Alola] (Rock/Electric): Alolan Geodude have developed an intense magnetic field, which will slightly slow all Steel type Pokemon in the arena. Geodude have the greatest variety of locomotion options amongst the Geodude family. They are capable of rolling, walking on their hands, or levitating, though they cannot hover very high and move quite slowly in this way. Geodude can see in the dark. Their Defense Curl will give them much more protection than most Pok&#233;mon. Geodude may disguise themselves as a normal boulder by rolling up, an effective hiding method against many Pok&#233;mon. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Electric energy, causing them to become Electric typed.</p>
<p>Gible (Dragon/Ground): Gible are very quick when digging near the surface of the ground and will deal slightly more damage with Dig. They can see in the dark. Any Pok&#233;mon that strikes Gible with a physical attack will suffer 25% recoil damage from their rough skin, unless their bodies are particularly hard. Their biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.1x more damage than usual. They are able to disguise themselves well in sandstorms and sandy arenas.</p>
<p>Gigalith (Rock): Despite resembling eyes, the holes on Gigalith's face are actually ears, making them effectively blind. However, these ears are extremely sensitive to vibrations both in the earth and the air, allowing them to detect their foe despite any visual obstructions. The orange gems on their bodies are shiny and glow when energy-based attacks are used, which can possibly give away their position when using the attack or help allies see in dark spaces. Their damage dealing light based moves deal 1.2x damage. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Girafarig (Normal/Psychic): Girafarig's head and tail are linked, so one head is not surprised unless they both are. The tail relies mostly on instinct, and will Bite at anything that comes near it, regardless of what it might be. The tail is also somewhat sensitive to smell, giving Girafarig a slight awareness of targets or threats behind them. Any attack executed with its hooves is 1.2x more powerful.</p>
<p>Giratina (Ghost/Dragon): Giratina is the embodiment of antimatter and parallel universes. It has two Formes, the Altered Forme, which is its preferred state when in our universe, and the Origin Forme, its state in the Distortion World. In the Altered Forme, it assumes a more dragon-like form, with large claw-like wings and six legs. While typically grounded in this state, it can also fly with reasonable speed and deftness. In Origin Forme, it assumes a snake-like state, more or less entirely airborne. Its flight abilities are fairly adept, allowing it to move somewhat faster and with more agility in the air. They are able to shift between dimensions for a short time using a move, allowing them to go effectively invisible for about a round. Giratina has access to both ethereal and solid forms, though its preferred state depends on its Forme. In the Altered Forme, it will prefer solid, and in the Origin Forme, it will prefer ethereal.</p>
<p>Glaceon (Ice): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Glaceon's light colouring and ice-like body patterns allow them to hide better among ice and in blizzards. Glaceon deals slightly more damage with Ice typed attacks than usual, and their frigid bodily temperatures cause physical contact to chill opponents more than normal. Their Hail attack is more potent than normal and, using a move, they may create hardened ice crystals over their body, reducing incoming physical damage by 10%. These crystals fade naturally after sustaining a few blows.</p>
<p>Glalie (Ice): Glalie levitate by default. Their appearance makes them intimidating and their fear based attacks are more effective than normal. They can see in the dark. Due to their massive jaw, biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful than normal. They are adept at hiding in blizzards and can see through them easily. If there is ice or snow in the arena, Glalie may eat the ice or snow using a move, restoring good health and energy once a battle. If the snow is tainted or poisoned, it will harm them instead. Their icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind. In its Mega Forme, it surges with icy energies, which actively sap the heat from the air. When using biting moves, it will chill the foe, chilling them as if they were hit with Glaciate. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Ice energy, causing them to become Ice typed.</p>
<p>Glameow (Normal): Though slower than their evolved form, Glameow are much more agile, and can use their springy tails to Bounce like a Spoink. They can see in the dark and are well adapted to moving silently. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As cats, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. Their tail based attacks are 1.1x more powerful.</p>
<p>Gligar (Ground/Flying): Gligar are not true fliers. Instead, they glide. If needed to, however, they are able to fly for short distances, and their claws allow them to grab and climb relatively smooth surfaces. They are also able to use a form of echolocation, allowing them to see through illusions, reveal hidden Pok&#233;mon and have a better sense of their surroundings in low-visibility situations. Gligar can see in the dark and fight more enthusiastically at night. They remain immune to Electric moves when in flight, though are affected as normal in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Gliscor (Ground/Flying): Gliscor are not true fliers. Instead, they glide. If needed to, however, they are able to fly for short distances, and their claws allow them to grab and climb relatively smooth surfaces. Upon evolving, their claws became much stronger and attacks that use them are 1.2x stronger then normal. They are also able to use a form of echolocation, allowing them to see through illusions, reveal hidden Pok&#233;mon and have a better sense of their surroundings in low-visibility situations. Gliscor can see in the dark and fight more enthusiastically at night. They remain immune to Electric moves when in flight, though are affected as normal in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Gloom (Grass/Poison): They smell absolutely horrible. Any Pok&#233;mon within five feet of them have a 20% chance of flinching and Pok&#233;mon within three feet will experience blurred vision and a slight reduction in attack and special attack. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Oddish line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. As a nocturnal Pok&#233;mon that thrives by the light of the moon, it can benefit from exposure to moonlight much like other Grass-types can from bright sun. Additionally, its Moonlight will not use Fairy energy if exposed to moonlight. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Gogoat (Grass): Gogoat are powerful and capable mounts, able to run at fairly high speeds and clear many ridges and potentially even relatively steep ledges. Pok&#233;mon of roughly equal height and up to twice the weight of Gogoat can ride them without any speed penalties, but Pok&#233;mon of bigger size may cause Gogoat to slow down or use more energy, or possibly be unable to ride Gogoat at all. They can scale sheer surfaces with greater ease than most Pok&#233;mon. Being goats, their ramming attacks are significantly more powerful than normal. They have two vines that stem from their neck.</p>
<p>Golbat (Poison/Flying): Golbat, unlike Zubat, can see, though they can use sonar if needed. They can see in the dark and have sensitive hearing, at the expense of increased vulnerability to sound based status attacks, though they are immune to confusion from Supersonic. Draining attacks used by Golbat drain faster than those used by other Pok&#233;mon if they are administered via a bite. They fight more enthusiastically at night.</p>
<p>Goldeen (Water): Goldeen are excellent swimmers. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. However, they are basically helpless out of water. Attacks made using their horn are 1.1x more powerful. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Golduck (Water): Golduck are considered to be familiar with the Psychic type. They are fast and agile both in and out of water.</p>
<p>Golem (Rock/Ground): Golem have extremely hard shells and take only 80% damage from physical attacks. However, they are weighted down by their girth, and are the slowest of all the Geodude family. That said, their Rollout attack is as fast as any other Pok&#233;mon and deals 1.2x damage. Golem can see in the dark. Their Defense Curl attack will give them much more protection than most Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Golem [Alola] (Rock/Electric): Alolan Golem have developed an intense magnetic field, which will slightly slow all Steel type Pokemon in the arena. The most drastically changed of the Geodude line, Alolan Golem have grown a large, electric construct on their back. Electric attacks fired from this protrusion will have an additional 10% chance to induce paralysis. Golem have extremely hard shells and take only 80% damage from physical attacks. However, they are weighted down by their girth, and are the slowest of all the Geodude family. Due to the awkward shape of their body, they are no longer as adept at using Rollout, though can still perform the move adequately.. Their Defense Curl attack will give them much more protection than most Pok&#233;mon. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Electric energy, causing them to become Electric typed.</p>
<p>Golett (Ground/Ghost): Golett are inorganic. Though slow and robotic, they are quite heavy and bulky for their size, allowing them to deal slightly more damage from physical attacks. They are more or less permanently solid and cannot change into the other states for extended periods, though they can become ethereal for a few seconds to lessen damage from attacks. They cannot levitate or fly in any way. Their invisible state is not true invisibility, but they can use Ghost energy to make themselves less visible for a short period of time for light energy. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Golisopod (Bug/Water): Despite their more threatening appearance, Golisopod are very skittish Pok&#233;mon, and will often run at the first sign of danger. When they drop under half health, they will become more evasive and a little more agile, but are much easier to frighten. Their developed claws cause moves used with them to deal an extra 20% damage.</p>
<p>Golurk (Ground/Ghost): Golurk are inorganic. Though slow and robotic, they are quite heavy and bulky for their size, allowing them to deal slightly more damage from physical attacks. Despite being very large and extremely heavy, Golurk have the astounding and mysterious ability to fly at high speeds through the air, though this can burn energy very swiftly. They are more or less permanently solid and cannot change into the other states for extended periods, though they can become ethereal for a few seconds to lessen damage from attacks. Their invisible state is not true invisibility, but they can use Ghost energy to make themselves less visible for a short period of time for light energy. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Goodra (Dragon): Although Goodra are much faster and more nimble than their pre-evolutions, they are still rather soft and squishy, taking 80% damage from physical attacks. Unlike their previous evolution, they are not blind. However, they can still use their antennae as a radar system, allowing them to detect their foe regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide. They use their horns and sticky arms to attack with great force, dealing fast attacks. Being natural swamp dwellers, they are more comfortable in wet environments.</p>
<p>Goomy (Dragon): Goomy are slow and slimy, but also rather soft and squishy, taking 90% damage from physical attacks. Their body is amorphous, allowing them to move across the ground by oozing or slithering, as well as making them hard to grasp. Being natural swamp dwellers, they are more comfortable in wet environments.</p>
<p>Gorebyss (Water): Gorebyss's body is built to accommodate feeding on the fluids of other creatures. Using a move, Gorebyss may siphon fluids from the foe by sticking them with their thin mouth, draining energy equivalent to Mega Drain. Gorebyss is considered familiar with the Psychic type. As a deep sea Pok&#233;mon, they can see in the dark well and is resistant to high pressure.</p>
<p>Gothita (Psychic): Gothita are skilled illusionists, able to create illusions much like with Hypnosis to fool their foes.

The Small size has somewhat less HP than average but is much faster than the larger sizes, where the Super size has a good deal more HP than average, but is very slow. Gourgeist have the ability to create searchlights from their eyes. While not as powerful as a Flash attack, they light up the arena without blinding opponents or allies, and doing so takes almost no energy to maintain. It is considered one move for a them to light searchlights. They are solid by default, but can become ethereal for a short time to evade attacks. As jack-o-lantern Pok&#233;mon, they are familiar with Fire-typed moves.</p>
<p>Granbull (Fairy): Granbull are proud Pok&#233;mon and more susceptible to moves that induce anger. However, they are also resistant to fear-inducing effects. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Granbull's biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful.</p>
<p>Graveler (Rock/Ground): Graveler lack the diversity of movement options and the toughness of Golem, however, they are the fastest and most agile of the Geodude family. Graveler have a small pair of hands near their chests that they can use for grappling or close-range attacks, but are not particularly dexterous. Graveler can see in the dark. Their Defense Curl will give them much more protection than most Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Graveler [Alola] (Rock/Electric): Alolan Graveler have developed an intense magnetic field, which will slightly slow all Steel type Pokemon in the arena.

<p>Greninja (Water/Dark): Greninja is the fastest and most agile member of the Froakie line, able to move as if it is teleporting, making it better at evading attacks, and easily cling to walls or hide in dark corners. They have an extremely keen sense of aim, and are able to reliably hit targets with projectiles even at a significant distance. Their water attacks have a "sharp" quality to them, making them more likely to break through hard objects and causing them to lose less momentum and power when breaking through screens or other shields. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Grimer (Poison): Grimer are made up of poisonous substances made of liquid slime. Thus, toxic or polluted chemicals heal them instead of harm them. The same is true for poison attacks. Grimer can see in the dark. They are also very flexible, and can fit through gaps that most Pok&#233;mon of their size couldn't. Their bodies absorb physical blows, and physical projectiles, making all attacks in these manners 80% effective. However, as the slime is liquidized, they take slightly more damage from electric attacks.</p>
<p>Grimer [Alola] (Poison/Dark): Alolan Grimer were imported to Alola to act as a method of disposing of unwanted trash. As a consequence, Alolan Grimer have absorbed some of the chemicals from the trash they have consumed.

<p>Groudon (Ground): Groudon is the embodiment of the power of the land and the sun. In Groudon's presence, the sunlight will always be harsh, and though this sun can be dispelled, it will take two Rain Dances to dispel and another to instate rain, whereas Groudon can reinstate harsh sun directly from rain. Hail and other weather effects will fail to work entirely. Groudon's massive size make it relatively slow on land, but powerful physically. Its Earthquake and other ground-manipulation techniques will work on all terrains and have double the range of the average Pok&#233;mon. In its Primal Reversion, Groudon becomes an ancient beast, the master of land and the sun. It gains a Fire-type as a consequence. Upon its Reversion, it summons drought-inducing sunlight. In this intense sun, all Water attacks will be rendered useless. All other effects of harsh sun will be in effect as well. This extreme sunlight can only be dispelled by Primal Kyogre's or Mega Rayquaza's presence in the arena, which will neutralize any weather effects.</p>
<p>Grovyle (Grass): Thanks to the small hooks on their feet, Grovyle are able to scale most vertical surfaces. Grovyle cannot be intimidated easily, and are therefore more resistant to fear-inducing attacks. Their slashing attacks are 1.1x more powerful. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Growlithe (Fire): Growlithe are extremely loyal and brave. They are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are also more resistant to fear-inducing effects. As dogs they are quite good diggers and deal 1.1x damage with their biting attacks.

<p>Grumpig (Psychic): Grumpig are excellent at using Bounce. They will use the attack much quicker then normal and can Bounce much higher then normal. They are not as mobile as Spoink but will deal more damage than other Pok&#233;mon when landing with Bounce. Grumpig's pearls boost their Psychic abilities, granting them much greater proficiency with telekinesis as well as a slightly higher offensive power with Psychic moves, but the pearls are well integrated into their body and cannot be taken.</p>
<p>Gulpin (Poison): Gulpin are stretchy and elastic, allowing them to easily change shape and size. They can inflate to raise their defense. They can swallow almost anything and can do so as a move, while their Stockpiled energy grows at a quicker rate than normal.</p>
<p>Gumshoos (Normal): Gumshoos have extremely strong jaws. This gives the Pok&#233;mon a 20% boost to biting attacks. They are also extremely patient Pok&#233;mon and will generally be able to outlast foes in standoffs and stalemates. This nature also allows them to more easily see through trickery and deception. They are capable of standing very still, making them difficult to detect and very adept hiders. Their Revenge and Payback attacks use slightly less energy than normal.</p>
<p>Gurdurr (Fighting): Gurdurr carry around heavy I-beam which can be used in Physical attacks involving smashing the foe. They are relatively deft with their weapon, able to nimbly wield it for attack and defense. Using it this way grants them 1.1x boost for an equivalent increase in energy use and a slight drop in movement speed speed. The beam can be dropped by Gurdurr to execute an attack under normal conditions and can be stolen from it, though it is very heavy and any thief must be fairly strong to do so.</p>
<p>Guzzlord (Dark/Dragon): Due to it's immense size, Guzzlord is neither fast nor agile, but it is incredibly sturdy, unlikely to be bowled over by even the strongest of hits. Using a move, Guzzlord can devour aspects of the arena in order to replenish Considerable health, but this may be only used once. Their strengthened jaws mean their biting attacks deal an additional 20% damage. Whenever Guzzlord defeats an opponent, they will regain Good health.</p>
<p>Gyarados (Water/Flying): Gyarados are terrifying and their fear based attacks are much more effective than normal. Gyarados are equally at home on land or in the water. They are not particularly agile in either medium despite their Flying typing, however. They can see in the dark. Their incredible jaw strength gives them a 20% boost to their biting attacks. In its Mega Forme, Gyarados becomes Water/Dark typed. Its appearance gives off an extremely intimidating aura, causing smaller and more timid Pok&#233;mon to cower, reducing the willingness of its foes to attack, as well as giving it the ability to intimidate Pok&#233;mon who would normally hold a resistance.</p>
<p>Hakamo-o (Dragon/Fighting): Hakamo-o are very proud and unshakeable Pok&#233;mon. It is difficult to discourage these Pok&#233;mon from battle. They are covered in thick scales that they can use both defensively and offensively. The scales give them protection from physical projectiles, which deal 10% less damage. Their roaring moves are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Happiny (Normal): Happiny are resistant to special attacks and will take less damage from them. However, they are weak to physical attacks, and take more damage from them than normal. Their physical attack stat is also slightly weaker than normal. They are good healers and healing moves used to benefit other Pok&#233;mon will cost them slightly less energy than normal. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Hariyama (Fighting): Hariyama are slow and lack agility but are sturdy and difficult to knock over. Hariyama have large, powerful hands and any attacks performed by use of their hands (Arm Thrust, Knock Off, possibly Rock Slide) do 1.2x more damage. This does not apply to fist attacks, such as Mega Punch or Dynamic Punch. Thanks to the thick layer of fat in their skin, Hariyama take 20% less damage from Ice and Fire-type attacks and are resistant to extreme temperatures. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Haunter (Ghost/Poison): Haunter, while more solid than its pre-evolution and able to solidify, are composed primarily of gas, and prefers Ethereal over Solid. They may also go Invisible if required. Haunter's hands can move independently of it and can move with agility and decent speed. They are able to pass through solid objects even when Haunter is Solid, with somewhat more freedom to pass through objects than Haunter itself, allowing them to pass through thicker walls or other objects. Haunter's Lick attack has a 50% chance to paralyze, instead of the usual 30%. Haunter levitate by default.</p>
<p>Hawlucha (Flying/Fighting): Though not extremely fast or proficient fliers, Hawlucha are extremely adept at aerial movement. Although they can maintain some level of flight, they prefer jumping and gliding, and can move extremely fast when launching from the ground. When executing physical moves, they can also more easily maneuver to evade counter-attacks or position themselves in an optimal place.</p>
<p>Haxorus (Dragon): Haxorus's tusks are tough and sharp. Any attacks utilizing these tusks are granted a 1.2x boost in power. The armor covering their bodies also gives them a slight boost to their defensive stats. Their fear inducing attacks are slightly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Heatmor (Fire): Heatmor are constantly producing and releasing fire, which can burn the foe with prolonged contact and be used for illumination. Heatmor can release fire from their mouth, fists and tail, allowing them to attack in a variety of fashions. Fire attacks issued from their mouth will be long and thin but easier to direct for a more centered hit, or used like a whip to lash the foe for a guaranteed hit but slightly less damage. Their powerful forelimbs allow them to dig with ease and grant them a 1.2x boost to attacks using their claws.</p>
<p>Heatran (Fire/Steel): Heatran is the embodiment of the earth's core. Very comfortable in magma, and can stay in it indefinitely. Its magma-based moves are slightly more powerful. It can walk on walls and ceilings.</p>
<p>Heliolisk (Electric/Normal): Heliolisk are extremely sensitive to changes in weather. Their frills act like solar panels. Using a move in bright sunlight, Heliolisk can extend their frills to absorb energy from the sun, restoring significant energy once per battle. Their dry skin is also very water absorbent, and it will restore minor energy every round in the rain. Due to living in a desert environment, they are also immune to damage from Sandstorms and can use electricity without seeing their moves lose power in the heat.</p>
<p>Helioptile (Electric/Normal): Helioptile are extremely sensitive to changes in weather. Their frills act like solar panels. Using a move in bright sunlight, Helioptile can extend their frills to absorb energy from the sun, restoring significant energy once per battle.

Due to living in a desert environment, they are immune to damage from Sandstorms and can use electricity without seeing their moves lose power in the heat.</p>
<p>Heracross (Bug/Fighting): Heracross can fly, though they are faster than they are agile in the air. Attacks made using their horn deal 1.2x damage and they are adept at flipping over their targets. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage. In its Mega Forme Heracross is slower, but much tougher. Although Heracross loses its flight ability and becomes somewhat less mobile, it gains a slight resistance against all attacks. Its body is specialized to shoot physical projectiles, gaining a boost in power and accuracy, allowing it to easily hit its targets from a distance. In addition, it becomes much more physically capable, able to grapple and hold opponents with much greater ease.</p>
<p>Herdier (Normal): Herdier have a thick coating of fur across their back that acts as an insulator, allowing them to resist the cold and be less affected by it as well as buffer them slightly against physical attacks. As dog Pok&#233;mon, they are fairly adept at digging and swimming, and do both with a bit more ease and speed than other Pok&#233;mon, doing both with a bit more ease and speed than other Pok&#233;mon, and deal 1.1x damage with their biting attacks. They are extremely loyal and brave and are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are also more resistant to fear-inducing effects. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Hippopotas (Ground): Hippopotas are full of sand and are able to use the sand in their body to produce Sandstorms, instead of relying on the sand in the arena. Their Sandstorm attack is more persistent than those used by other Pok&#233;mon and will last longer and deal more damage. Unlike real life hippos, Hippopotas prefer dry, arid environments and will fight more enthusiastically in such conditions.</p>
<p>Hippowdon (Ground): Hippowdon are full of sand and are able to use the sand in their body to produce Sandstorms, instead of relying on the sand in the arena. Their Sandstorm attack is more persistent than those used by other Pok&#233;mon and will last longer and deal more damage. Their biting attacks will deal 1.2x damage. Unlike real life hippos, Hippowdon prefers dry, arid environments and will fight more enthusiastically in such conditions.</p>

<p>Hitmonlee (Fighting): Hitmonlee train extensively in the way of the foot. Their kicking attacks do 1.2x damage, but their punch attacks deal only 0.8x damage. They have slightly higher physical attack than other Fighting-types. Hitmonlee can extend their limbs to up to twice their length to hit distant targets or to increase their stride.</p>
<p>Hitmontop (Fighting): Hitmontop is equally happy punching or kicking. It stands on its head for most attacks. Attacks that involve spinning deal 1.2x damage and they have exceptional balance, making them difficult to knock down when spinning and giving them greater acrobatic prowess, making their physical attacks harder to predict or block.</p>
<p>Ho-oh (Fire/Flying): Ho-oh is the guardian of the skies. As such, it is a strong flier and while not exceptionally fast, it is quite graceful and can reach high altitudes without issue. Its internal flame burns white hot, causing its fire attacks to glow a bright, rosy red, increasing their damage by 20%. Its rather imposing stature will cause most Pok&#233;mon to feel somewhat uncomfortable in its presence.</p>
<p>Honchkrow (Dark/Flying): Honchkrow are symbols of woe amongst Pok&#233;mon and people, particularly when seen at night, so they may make opponents feel uneasy. Honchkrow have influence over Murkrow. If a Honchkrow is fighting a Murkrow, the Murkrow will be more reluctant to damage it. Honchkrow are quiet fliers and can easily evade detection, though they are slower and less agile than Murkrow. However, they are also outstandingly confident, and this will only empower them further, granting them a boost similar to Work Up whenever they KO an opposing Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Honedge (Steel/Ghost): Honedge are possessed swords, their body entirely made up of the blade and sheath, making them inorganic. All attacks involving slashing get a 10% boost in power. They levitate by default. They always grip their sheath with their cloth, somewhat weighted down by the heavy metal protector. Using a move, Honedge can sheath themselves, making them unable to use slashing attacks but meaning they take only 80% damage from attacks. As they are bound to a physical object, they are can only achieve ethereal for a short time using light energy. They can also become invisible, but their sheath will not be affected.</p>
<p>Hoopa (Psychic/Ghost): Hoopa can create large golden rings in the air and, using a move, can Teleport itself or its opponent to a position in the arena of Hoopa's choice. Hoopa-Confined is a natural prankster, and as such its non-damaging moves when used are almost instantaneous in their effect. In the Unbound forme, Hoopa's body changes drastically as it increases massively in size and adopts a Psychic/Dark typing. Hoopa-U is Hoopa at its most powerful, and as such deals 1.1x damage with all of its attacks. Hoopa-U's arms can move independently of it and can move with agility and decent speed.</p>
<p>Hoothoot (Normal/Flying): As owls, Hoothoot and Noctowl are the quietest fliers amongst Pok&#233;mon, and are almost inaudible as they fly. Hoothoot can see in the dark and fight more enthusiastically at night. Their Hypnosis and Foresight attacks are more effective than normal and take less energy to perform. They are resistant to sleep inducing moves.</p>
<p>Hoppip (Grass/Flying): Hoppip fly mostly by the force of the wind, or if there is no wind, they glide. While they are able to fly somewhat under their own power, it is tiring for a Hoppip and used only to catch a breeze. Thus, a Hoppip will try to stay in the air unless it has no alternative. Hoppip benefit from bright sun more than most Grass-types. Additionally, they are immune being afflicted with a status effect while bright sun is in effect.</p>
<p>Horsea (Water): A Horsea is much more at home in the water than on land. They are good swimmers, though more agile than fast. On land, they can only hop, and are easily knocked over. They can see in the dark. They are natural sharpshooters, possessing much better accuracy than other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Houndoom (Dark/Fire): Any burns caused by a Houndoom's attack do more damage than usual. A Houndoom have sensitive hearing, at the expense of increased vulnerability to sound based status attacks, and smell, which allows them to easily track foes and tell Double Team clones apart. Much like the Growlithe family, while more reluctant to bond, they are fiercely loyal to those who earn their trust. As dogs they are quite good diggers and deal 1.2x damage with their biting attacks. In its Mega Forme, the bones around its torso act as a defensive buffer, giving it a slight boost in defense for all attacks that hit around that area. It also is particularly sensitive to the sun, giving it a boost to its normal Special attacks as well as its Fire attacks in bright sunlight.</p>
<p>Houndour (Dark/Fire): Houndour have hearing that is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.

<p>Hydreigon (Dark/Dragon): Hydreigon are extremely frightening, violent, temperamental and intimidating Pok&#233;mon. They levitate almost constantly, though are somewhat slow due to their size. Their hands have developed into two heads, both completely under the control of the main head and used to attack, both physically and specially, and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal. They are extremely sensitive to movement and are able to target a foe even at a significant distance or if they are hiding. Despite their great power, they are very hard to control and easy to anger, and may potentially disobey their trainer, especially if angered or otherwise displeased.</p>
<p>Hypno (Psychic): Hypno focus on sleep-related attacks. Their Hypnosis, Dream Eater, and Nightmare attacks are more powerful than normal and will take effect more quickly. Hypno releases its Hypnosis through its pendulum. If a foe looks too intently at the pendulum, its movement may make them dizzy and a bit disoriented, though not confused.</p>
<p>Igglybuff (Normal/Fairy): Igglybuff are somewhat bouncy, taking slightly less damage from falls and blunt impacts, instead bouncing which could potentially be disrupting. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Illumise (Bug): Volbeat and Illumise are considered male and female variations of the same Pok&#233;mon, and therefore the Attracts of both species are considered to work as if both Volbeat and Illumise were the same species of Pok&#233;mon. Illumise have a light on their tail that they can use to illuminate areas though they make them more visible in the dark. Illumise are familiar with the Electric type.</p>
<p>Incineroar (Fire/Dark): Incineroar are violently destructive, making them more susceptible to rage inducing moves but granting a more potent boost to attack when they succumb to rage. In addition, their arms are overwhelmingly powerful, granting a 20% boost to all moves used with them. Being unable to properly regulate their strength, Incineroar will cause more knock back with their physical moves than other Pokemon. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Infernape (Fire/Fighting): Infernape have flames on their head. These only go out when sleeping and can be used for illumination and to burn the foe if there is prolonged contact. They will increase and decrease in size depending on how intense the battle is, with a larger plume as the situation goes dire. Infernape are extremely good climbers, allowing them to scale most walls and surfaces and swing from vines and branches with ease. Additionally, their dexterity makes any moves with their hands 1.1x powerful and makes their grip more difficult to escape. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Inkay (Dark/Psychic): Inkay are able to bioluminesce, allowing them to light up a dark area for an extended period of time by using a move. It costs no energy to maintain this light. Their light-based attacks are slightly more potent than normal. They also can maintain their accuracy regardless of their orientation. They can levitate, moving through small, thrusting motions, much like an aquatic squid which makes them agile but not particularly fast. They are also fairly able swimmers and can stay underwater as long as any Water type. They can expel ink as a defense, using little energy but at the cost of a move, which can be used to blind opponents.</p>
<p>Ivysaur (Grass/Poison): Ivysaur are less agile than their previous form but are faster. They have two vines hidden beneath their bulb that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Jangmo-o (Dragon): Jangmo-o are very proud and unshakeable Pok&#233;mon. It is difficult to discourage these Pok&#233;mon from battle. They are covered in thick scales that they can use both defensively and offensively. The scales give them protection from physical projectiles, which deal 10% less damage.</p>
<p>Jellicent (Water/Ghost): Despite their resemblance to jellies, Jellicent can actually survive outside of the water for long periods of time. However, they fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizable body of water. They can levitate, though they are not particularly fast or agile in the air. They are usually solid, but can go ethereal for short periods of time. If another Pok&#233;mon makes contact with them using a move, there is a 20% chance that that move will be disabled for a period of three rounds. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Jigglypuff (Normal/Fairy): Jigglypuff can inflate themselves as a move to intimidate opponents, making them more hesitant to attack. While inflated, they have a harder time moving, but a moderately higher defense. Despite their lack of agility in this inflated state, they can float in to the air at a steady pace. Their Sing attack is more effective, requiring less be sung to put an opponent to sleep.</p>
<p>Jirachi (Psychic/Steel): Jirachi is the embodiment of wishes. As such, luck tends to be in its favor. The secondary effects of moves performed by Jirachi have a chance of happening are 10% more likely to occur, and those of moves performed by foes are half as likely. Jirachi's Wish restores significant energy and suffers from diminishing returns much less so than a normal Wish.</p>
<p>Jolteon (Electric): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Jolteon's bodies are spiky, making physical contact and grabbing/wrap attacks painful for the Pok&#233;mon wrapping Jolteon. Jolteon charge electricity in their fur constantly so its Electric attacks take slightly less time to charge compared to other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Joltik (Bug/Electric): Joltik's extremely small size make them difficult to spot. This makes them somewhat weaker to physical attacks and makes their physical attacks somewhat less effective. Joltik, however, have the special capabilities of any other Pok&#233;mon and are extremely nimble climbers that can climb sheer surfaces, allowing for other forms of attack and evasion. Much like Ariados, they are able to travel using their String Shot, which is slightly charged with electrical energy and can do slight electrical damage on contact, and will be more effective than usual.</p>
<p>Jumpluff (Grass/Flying): While not much of a real flier in the flapping-wings sense, Jumpluff can use its spores like balloons, inflating and deflating them to maintain whatever height desired. This means they can easily take off and do not require a breeze, though having one greatly increases their speed and agility. They benefit from bright sun more than most Grass-types. Additionally, they are immune being afflicted with a status effect while bright sun is in effect.</p>
<p>Jynx (Ice/Psychic): Jynx's kiss attacks are more effective than normal and any Pok&#233;mon they feel with their lips has a 10% chance of paralysis or confusion. They communicate using dancing and are more effective at using moves like Attract. Their rhythmic swaying is distracting to the opponent, causing them to be somewhat slower to react than they normally would be. Jynx come in both sexes. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Kabuto (Rock/Water): Kabuto have a protected top, where their top eyes are located, and will take a bit less damage from attacks which hit there. However, their underside is weak and unprotected, taking a bit more damage. They have a hard time righting themselves if knocked over. They are not very agile but can move reasonably fast on land and in the water. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Kabutops (Rock/Water): Kabutops are sleeker than their previous form and thus much faster both in and out of water. Their slashing attacks deal 1.2x more damage than usual. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Kadabra (Psychic): Kadabra emit special alpha waves as a by-product of their psychic abilities. These waves induce headaches and will disrupt the concentration of Pok&#233;mon within five feet of Kadabra. They are more resistant (but not completely immune) to sleep-inducing attacks. Kadabra can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Kakuna (Bug/Poison): Kakuna are almost completely immobile and move only when attacking. They move mostly by hopping and can latch on to trees and branches to stabilise themselves. Their Harden is much more effective than normal and they are slightly resistant to all attacks.</p>
<p>Kangaskhan (Normal): Kangaskhan come in both genders, though females are much more likely to have babies with them than males are. Along with battling, a Kangaskhan is most concerned about its child. If an opponent injures the child, Kangaskhan will go into a blind rage against them, which will last until either the offending Pokémon or Kangaskhan is unconscious. During this time, Kangaskhan's offensive stats are significantly enhanced, making them a good deal more aggressive, though they will continue to perform defensive techniques to help protect their baby, unlike states like Taunt. Kangaskhan without joeys are slightly less concerned about defending themselves, and as a consequence, will act slightly more aggressive and be slightly more agile, due to not having to worry about the safety of their child. Kangaskhan’s Comet Punch will always deal maximum number of hits. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy. In its Mega Forme, the child quickly matures. The joey will mimic all its parent’s actions, performing the same moves that the parent does at a quarter of the power, effectively giving all its attacks a 25% boost in power, provided both hits connect. The joey is also capable of performing attacks independently of its parent, though only at 25% of their original power, though it will still cost a move. They may also stagger their attacks if using the same move without using an extra move. Due to the power of Mega Evolution, the joey cannot be directly harmed, and area of effect attacks will not cause Kangaskhan extra damage as a consequence. Targeting the joey will not lower Kangaskhan's health, but it may stop the joey's attacks. All energy used by the joey is pulled directly from the parent, who feeds the joey with energy to maintain its temporary matured state. Kangaskhan without a joey cannot Mega Evolve.</p>
<p>Karrablast (Bug): Karrablast can spit an acidic irritant to ward off foes. Moves using their horn deal 1.1x damage. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Kartana (Grass/Steel): Kartana uses levitation to move, but is both quick and agile, able to perform sharp turns rapidly with little trouble. Its bladed arms are incredibly sharp, giving it a 20% boost to all slashing attacks, as well as giving them a slight chance to inflict a sore spot similar to Crush Claw at the point of impact. Whenever Kartana defeats an opponent, they gain a slight boost to their physical Attack.</p>
<p>Kecleon (Normal): When Kecleon use Camouflage, their stripe remains visible, so they can still be tracked, although it is much harder. They will be much less likely to make movements which will attract opponents attention, moving carefully without sacrificing speed or agility. Attacks based upon trickery are slightly more effective when used by Kecleon. Their tongue can be used to attack with physical moves quickly from a reasonable distance.</p>
<p>Keldeo (Water/Fighting): The youngest of the Swords of Justice, Keldeo is a swift and adept battler, using it small size to its advantage. Keldeo is a fast and nimble Pok&#233;mon, able to move across the ground with significant speed and agility in spite of its horse-like physique. It can issue water from its hooves that allows it to move more quickly across the ground, and even allows it to run across the surface of water. Its legs are rather strong, giving it a 20% boost to all kicking attacks. In its Resolute Forme, it grows slightly more agile and somewhat more powerful. Its slashing attacks are 20% more effective, though it loses the boost to kicking attacks. It is able to travel rather fast, making it difficult to follow, but it is not as agile as its Ordinary Forme.</p>
<p>Kingdra (Water/Dragon): The largest of the Horsea family, they are extremely fast and agile in the water. However, they can only hop on land and are easily knocked over. They can see in the dark. They are natural sharpshooters, possessing much better accuracy than other Pok&#233;mon. Their Whirlpool attack has a much stronger pull than normal, and will linger for a round more than usual. In addition, their vast power allows them to summon much stronger rain, making their Rain Dance more potent and harder to dispel. Contact with their spines will hold a 10% chance to cause the attacker to become poisoned.</p>
<p>Kingler (Water): Kingler can swim, but prefer to walk along the bottom of the water instead of swim in it. Kingler use their pincers based on the attack. Attacks that are quicker and more precise use the smaller claw, while the most powerful attacks take advantage of their powerful claw, which can crush almost anything. Attacks using their larger claw will deal 1.2x the usual damage. They can easily move side to side, but have difficulty walking forwards and backwards. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Kirlia (Psychic/Fairy): Kirlia's empathic abilities make them very in touch with their opponent. Attacks that deal with the opponents mental state are more effective. They also have a very good sense of balance and are hard to knock down. Teleporting also requires slightly less energy.</p>
<p>Klang (Steel): Klang's multiple gears are bound together by a powerful electrical force and are constantly turning to maintain it. They can break apart for a short time (e.g. to perform an attack) but will be drawn back together immediately afterwards. If they stay apart much longer than that, they will suffer fatigue more quickly, but while they stay together they are less susceptible to fatigue than other Pokémon. They also charge attacks more quickly while bound together. Their constant movement generates and maintains an electric field, which allows them to be affected by Magnetic Flux and also gives them unlimited Electric energy. They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in man made environments. They levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pokémon, but are much more agile.</p>
<p>Klefki (Steel/Fairy): Klefki collect a large variety of keys on their ring, never letting them go. They can use them to attack physically or jangle them to create a loud sound to threaten or distract foes. Klefki levitate by default. Due to being a living keyring, they are inorganic. Natural pranksters, they use non damaging moves that target the foe faster than usual.</p>
<p>Klink (Steel): Klink are bound together by a powerful electrical force and are constantly turning to maintain it. They can break apart for a short time (e.g. to perform an attack) but will be drawn back together immediately afterwards. If they stay apart much longer than that, they will suffer fatigue more quickly, but while they stay together they are less susceptible to fatigue than other Pokémon. They also charge attacks more quickly while bound together. Their constant movement generates and maintains an electric field, which allows them to be affected by Magnetic Flux and also gives them unlimited Electric energy. They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in man made environments. They levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pokémon, but are much more agile.</p>

They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in man made environments. They levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pokémon, but are much more agile.</p>
<p>Koffing (Poison): Koffing levitate by default. They are made of poison. Thus, they thrive in environments where such poisons abound. They are healed by toxic chemicals instead of harmed, and poison attacks heal them instead of harm them. Koffing use their internal gases to move and float about: however, they cannot go under water, instead it will float at the top. Koffing have a 5% chance of Exploding when KO'ed. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Komala (Normal): Komala are constantly in a state of lucid sleep, much like Abra, being responsive and battling in spite of their seemingly catatonic state. Unlike Abra, however, they are quite vulnerable to being put entirely to sleep, but benefit from a resistance to other statuses, including mental. They cling to a "log pillow", given to them at birth. This log can be used in attacks. If it is separated from the log, it will fight tenaciously until it is returned, increasing their attack temporarily at the cost of being less willing to use defensive techniques.</p>
<p>Kommo-o (Dragon/Fighting): Kommo-o are very proud and unshakeable Pok&#233;mon. It is difficult to discourage these Pok&#233;mon from battle. They are covered in thick scales that they can use both defensively and offensively. The scales give them protection from physical projectiles, which deal 20% less damage. Their roaring moves are slightly more effective. They specialize in uppercuts and their Sky Uppercut is 10% more powerful. It's roaring moves are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Krabby (Water): Krabby can swim, but prefer to walk along the bottom of the water instead of swim in it. Krabby are proficient at using their claws to manipulate objects, and their intense grip gives them a x1.1 boost to claw attacks. They can easily move side to side, but have difficulty walking forwards and backwards. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Kricketot (Bug): Kricketot can produce sounds and patterns that only those of the species can understand in order to communicate. Their sound based attacks are more potent and have greater range, retaining full power even when spread.

<p>Krokorok (Ground/Dark): Krokorok have a dark membrane covering their eyes, acting like sunglasses to protect them from bright light and sandstorms. They are somewhat resistant to light-based attacks as a result and can see well in bright sunlight. Their eyes are also somewhat sensitive to heat, allowing them to see very well in the dark. As crocodile Pok&#233;mon, their biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful. However, their jaw muscles are meant for clamping down, not opening up: most Pok&#233;mon can easily keep them shut with their own hands.</p>
<p>Krookodile (Ground/Dark): Krookodile have a dark membrane covering their eyes, acting like sunglasses to protect them from bright light and sandstorms. They are somewhat resistant to light-based attacks as a result and can see well in bright sunlight.

As crocodile Pok&#233;mon, their biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful. However, their jaw muscles are meant for clamping down, not opening up: most Pok&#233;mon can easily keep them shut with their own hands.</p>
<p>Kyogre (Water): Kyogre is the embodiment of the ferocity of the sea and the rain. In Kyogre's presence, it will always rain, and though this rain can be dispelled, it will take two Sunny Days to dispel it and another to instate sun, whereas Kyogre can reinstate rain directly from harsh sunlight. Hail and other weather will fail to work entirely. Kyogre's massive size makes it a less-than-graceful but powerful swimmer. Its Surf and Whirlpool attacks are approximately 10 times the size of average. In its Primal Reversion, Kyogre becomes an ancient beast, master of the seas and storms. Upon its Reversion, it summons a massive deluge that cannot be dispelled. In this violent rainstorm, all Fire attacks will be rendered useless. All other effects of rain will be in effect as well. This heavy rain can only be dispelled by Primal Groudon's or Mega Rayquaza's presence in the arena, which will neutralize any weather effects.</p>
<p>Kyurem (Ice/Dragon): Kyurem is the greyed husk of the legendary Unova Dragon, representing the lack of energy and the cold. Kyurem's body is surrounded by frigid air. Pok&#233;mon who are not used to the cold will become uncomfortable within 5 feet of Kyurem. This aura also slightly reduces the power of Fire attacks. Its wind-based Ice attacks will come out nearly instantly and its chilling effects will be more potent. Using DNA splicers, Kyurem can fuse with either Reshiram, to become White Kyurem, or Zekrom, to become Black Kyurem. In its White Forme, it can use Fusion Flare as if it were STAB, and in its Black Forme, it can use Fusion Bolt as if it were STAB. Additionally, Ice Burn in White Forme and Freeze Shock in Black Forme will be slightly more potent, and Freeze Shock can be used without using Electric type energy. In both Formes, Kyurem gains some flight ability equivalent to that of Zekrom and Reshiram.</p>
<p>Lairon (Steel/Rock): Lairon can see in the dark. Due to their exceptional hardness, they will not take recoil damage from attacks they use and take slightly less damage from physical attacks.</p>
<p>Lampent (Ghost/Fire): Lampent's flame is made from a ghostly fire which only sheds light when it desires. Though this light can be used to illuminate dark spaces for long periods of time, it can also be turned off so that, despite still burning, they do not illuminate anything. Lampent can levitate. Their arms, despite seeming solid, are actually relatively moveable and prehensile. Lampent are generally solid, with the exception of their flame which counts as ethereal. They can phase temporarily into the ethereal state to lessen damage from moves. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Landorus (Ground/Flying): Landorus is the embodiment of fertility and the guardian of the Forces of Nature. Any soil in its presence will be considered to be under the effects of Rototiller. Using a move, it can fill the arena with energy a la Grassy Terrain, though Nature Power will become Earthquake, Weather Ball will be Ground-typed, and Ground moves will be slightly stronger. It is able to float as if it were flying, maneuvering through the air with reasonable speed and agility. In its Therian Forme, it becomes a fierce beast. Its form is rather intimidating, easily startling more timid Pok&#233;mon. Its flight ability is roughly equivalent to its Incarnate Forme. It remains immune to Electric moves when in flight, though are affected as normal in wet conditions.</p>
<p>Lanturn (Water/Electric): Lanturn are fish and thus are slow and nearly immobile on land, but are faster and more agile in the water. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. Whenever a Lanturn uses an electric attack in the water, it creates a small amount of electricity around it, shocking anything in the water with it within 10 feet of it (damage is considered equal to a Thunder Shock for the most powerful electric attacks). They may also use their antennae as a light source in the same way that the Mareep family does with their tails. </p>
<p>Lapras (Water/Ice): Lapras are slow and ungainly on land, but are incredibly fast and agile in water, particularly on the surface. As carrier Pok&#233;mon, Lapras can carry up to 1.5 times their weight and not have their speed affected. Lapras' shell are hard, and any attacks there are reduced to 75% damage. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Larvesta (Bug/Fire): Larvesta shoot fire from the five horns around their face. They move mainly by crawling, and although somewhat slow at first, can build significant momentum, especially when done in tandem with their ability to issue fire which allows them to jump quite well and propel themselves somewhat.</p>
<p>Larvitar (Rock/Ground): A trainer may order Larvitar to eat the soil as a move. Larvitar will eat a mouthful, increasing its health and energy a little. Poisonous soil will have the opposite effect, damaging Larvitar instead of healing it. Larvitar can see in the dark. Their bodies are full of sand, and they are able to use the sand to produce Sandstorms, instead of relying on the sand in the arena.</p>
<p>Latias (Dragon/Psychic): Latias' body is shaped for optimal aerodynamics, allowing Latias to reach high speeds and perform agile maneuvers with great ease. Latias' body is covered in a fine down of refractive feather-like scales which allow her to reflect light to appear invisible. This ability is similar to the invisibility usable by Ghosts, but is difficult to maintain for an extended period of time, and can only be used for two rounds per battle. In her Mega Forme, she becomes better equipped for high altitude flight. Using her wing-like arms, she can easily control her speed and reach high speeds as well as come to a near stop in an extremely short amount of time. </p>
<p>Latios (Dragon/Psychic): Latios' body is shaped for optimal aerodynamics, allowing Latias to reach high speeds and perform agile maneuvers with great ease. Latios' body is covered in a fine down of refractive feather-like scales which allow him to reflect light to appear invisible. This ability is similar to the invisibility usable by Ghosts, but is difficult to maintain for an extended period of time, and can only be used for two rounds per battle. In his Mega Forme, he becomes better equipped for high altitude flight. Using his wing-like arms, he can easily control his speed and reach high speeds as well as come to a near stop in an extremely short amount of time.</p>
<p>Leafeon (Grass): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Leafeon constantly produce clean air, especially when in sunlight, allowing them to rid areas of Smog, Mist or other pollutants at a faster rate than normal. Leafeon take slightly less damage from physical attacks compared to other Eeveelutions and can move almost silently when in a forested area.</p>
<p>Leavanny (Bug/Grass): Leavanny are dressed in a wrapping of leaves, allowing them to more easily hide amongst trees and bushes than other Grass-types. If their clothing is shed willingly (using a move) or destroyed, they will automatically craft a new one out of nearby foliage. Shedding can remove externally applied statuses like burns, toxic sludge or spore attacks. Their silk makes their String Shot and similar attacks stronger than usual. Like a Spinarak, they can use this to pull themselves from place to place more quickly without it counting as a move. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Ledian (Bug/Flying): Ledian are agile fliers and will be able to out-fly most flying Bug-types. Their punching moves deal 1.2x damage for no additional energy. They are more effective in numbers. When battling alongside another Bug-typed Pok&#233;mon, they gain a boost in confidence that gives them a boost in attack. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Ledyba (Bug/Flying): Ledyba are agile fliers and will be able to out-fly most flying Bug-types. Their punching moves deal 1.1x damage for no additional energy. They are more effective in numbers. When battling alongside another Bug-typed Pok&#233;mon, they gain a boost in confidence that gives them a boost in attack. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Lickilicky (Normal): Lickilicky have long tongues, which can extend out to ten feet to hit enemies. Any attack a Lickilicky does with its tongue deals x1.2 damage, with a 10% chance of paralysis. Lickilicky's rotund bodies allow them to gain momentum through Rollout easier. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Lickitung (Normal): Lickitung have long tongues, which can extend out to eight feet to hit enemies. Any attack a Lickitung does with its tongue deals x1.1 damage, with a 10% chance of paralysis.</p>
<p>Liepard (Dark): Liepard are mischievous and deceptive Pok&#233;mon, using their cuteness and playfulness to distract the foe and strike. Any attacks involving deception or distraction will be more successful. They are well adapted to moving silently. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed.</p>
<p>Lileep (Rock/Grass): Lileep can stick to the ground to absorb nutrients. Lifting or trying to move this Pok&#233;mon will count as it having double weight. Lileep's Ingrain is more effective than normal. While they are capable of movement when not rooted down, they are quite slow, as they must hop around to get around. As a sea lily, their natural habitat is the ocean, allowing them to stay underwater indefinitely. They also take slightly less damage from Water-type attacks. They are capable of seeing in the dark. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Lilligant (Grass): Lilligant emanate a soothing scent constantly that acts much the same way as Sweet Scent. Their effects are potent in close quarters, but quickly lose strength outside of three feet from them. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Petilil line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. Lilligant's dancing moves are more effective than normal and are immune to the disorientating effects of Petal Dance. In bright sunlight, Lilligant are more enthusiastic and energetic than usual.</p>
<p>Lillipup (Normal): Lillipup are extremely loyal and brave and are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are also more resistant to fear-inducing effects. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. As dog Pok&#233;mon, they are fairly adept at digging and swimming, doing both with a bit more ease and speed than other Pok&#233;mon, and deal 1.1x damage with their biting attacks.</p>
<p>Linoone (Normal): Linoone are faster then average, and are a bit quicker on the move and when attacking, however, they are not especially agile, and do not handle turning very well. Due to their incredible speed, their tackling and ramming attacks deal x1.2 more damage than normal. They are able to bend their bodies adequately to avoid attacks or get into areas that other Pok&#233;mon cannot. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They are also skilled at digging.</p>
<p>Litleo (Fire/Normal): Litleo are very proud and confident Pok&#233;mon. Though still young and playful, they can be rather aggressive. Any move involving roaring or growling will be more intimidating and more effective when used by Litleo. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to sound-based status attacks. Their sense of smell is similarly enhanced, allowing them to track foes and detect true foes in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Litten (Fire): Litten fuels its flame attacks partly through burning the fur it sheds from its body. This allows them to use weaker Fire moves at an increased speed. Being Pokemon accustomed to solitude, they are less easily swayed by emotional displays such as Charm or Fake Tears. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Litwick (Ghost/Fire): Litwick's flame is made from a ghostly fire which only sheds light when Litwick desires. Though this light can be used to illuminate dark spaces for long periods of time, it can also be turned off so that, despite still burning, it does not illuminate anything. Litwick move primarily by hopping, though, by melting some of their wax, they can ooze to move around the arena. They can levitate, but are not particularly fast or agile, packing a lower flight ceiling than most levitating Pok&#233;mon. Litwick are generally solid, with the exception of their flame which counts as ethereal. They can phase temporarily into the ethereal state to lessen damage from moves. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Lombre (Grass/Water): Though able to swim and stay underwater for a fair amount of time, Lombre are not the best swimmers and prefer to stay near the surface of the water. They benefit from rain much more than other Grass Pok&#233;mon and fight more enthusiastically in the rain.</p>
<p>Lopunny (Normal): Lopunny are able to jump much higher than the typical Pok&#233;mon. They can use their ears in attacks, allowing them to extend their range for physical attacks. Their Charm, Attract, and similar attacks are more effective than normal. In its Mega Forme, Lopunny becomes an extremely deft and nimble fighter, becoming Normal/Fighting type. Its jumping abilities become slightly greater, and its punching and kicking moves become x1.2 more effective. It also becomes quite faster, able to more easily evade attacks and perform acrobatic moves.</p>
<p>Lotad (Water/Grass): Though able to swim and stay underwater for a fair amount of time, Lotad are not the best swimmers and prefer to stay near the surface of the water. They benefit from rain much more than other Grass Pok&#233;mon and fight more enthusiastically in the rain.</p>
<p>Loudred (Normal): Loudred have sensitive hearing but are unaffected by sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They still take damage from such moves where applicable. Their sound moves are slightly more potent, and can be used at standard potency even when spread. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Lucario (Fighting/Steel): Lucario are very sensitive the aura of Pok&#233;mon. Using a move, Lucario can close their eyes and sense the location of a Pok&#233;mon. This can be sustained indefinitely as long as Lucario's eyes are closed. In its Mega Forme, their aura-based capabilities become extremely potent, giving it full aura-vision, allowing it to see and track a foe anywhere and in any state, seeing through illusions or invisibility. This does not require a move to activate. They also become a much more adept physical fighter, able to attack with more speed and combo attacks more successfully.</p>
<p>Ludicolo (Water/Grass): Though able to swim and stay underwater for a fair amount of time, Ludicolo are not the best swimmers and prefer to stay near the surface of the water. They benefit from rain much more than other Grass Pok&#233;mon and fight more enthusiastically in the rain. Dancing-related moves used by Ludicolo are slightly more potent, and a Rain Dance performed by Ludicolo will last one round longer.</p>
<p>Lugia (Psychic/Flying): Lugia is the guardian of the seas. Despite not being a Water-type, Lugia is able to swim and dive with great grace and moderate speed, as well as being able to stay underwater for an infinite period. Lugia's flight abilities are also relatively strong, and though it is not particularly fast, it is rather deft and agile in the air. Its powerful wings give any wind-based moves generated with the wings a 20% boost in power. Its rather imposing stature will cause most Pok&#233;mon to feel somewhat uncomfortable in its presence.</p>
<p>Lumineon (Water): As a butterfly fish, their wind attacks are more effective than normal. Lumineon have more type energy than normal for all of their wind based attacks. They are able to bioluminesce, allowing them to light up a dark area for an extended period of time by using a move. It costs no energy to maintain this light. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Lunala (Psychic/Ghost): Lunala devours all light that surrounds it, plunging any and all arenas into a thick darkness. Despite this, Lunala can use Moonlight to full effectiveness under any conditions. Being a creature able to manipulate dimensional space, their Teleport attack is near instantaneous and can cover a much wider distance than normal. As Ghost Pokemon, they can turn ethereal for a few seconds to aid in mitigating damage, but can be poisoned. Due to their intense connection to the moon, they are considered familiar with the Fairy type.</p>
<p>Lunatone (Rock/Psychic): Lunatone levitate by default and are considered to be inorganic. They are familiar with the Ice type. They fight more enthusiastically at night and can see in the dark. They also radiate a constant faint glow that is likened to moonlight. Pok&#233;mon in close proximity to them can use moves which require moonlight, regardless of location, as can Lunatone themselves. Using a move, they can cause their eyes to glow with an eerie red light which will intimidate most Pok&#233;mon. </p>
<p>Lurantis (Grass): Despite being a Grass Pok&#233;mon, Lurantis is largely nocturnal, preferring to spend its days absorbing sunlight and standing still. As such, it fights quite enthusiastically at night. Because it spends all day storing solar energy, it can use solar-based attacks in any conditions, including indoors, at night, and in the dark. However, using these moves in conditions where the sun is not present will wind it slightly more than average. Its sickle-like petals give it a 20% boost to slashing attacks.</p>
<p>Luvdisc (Water): Attract, Sweet Kiss and similar attacks are greatly boosted when used by Luvdisc. Luvdisc are less affected by emotion and attacks attempting to change their emotional state are less effective. They are a very nimble swimmers even compared to other Water-types. They can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Luxio (Electric): Luxio's hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to sound-based status attacks. Their sense of smell is similarly enhanced, allowing them to track foes and detect true foes in a Double Team. They have excellent eye sight. Their fear-inducing attacks are slightly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Luxray (Electric): Luxray's hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to sound-based status attacks. Their sense of smell is similarly enhanced, allowing them to track foes and detect true foes in a Double Team. Luxray have limited X-ray vision, allowing them to see through many objects to aid in pursuit, and excellent eye sight generally. Their fear-inducing attacks are slightly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Lycanroc [Midday] (Rock): Under the influence of the sun, Lycanroc evolves into its midday form. As they have formed a strong bond with their trainer, they are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are slightly more fast and agile than their Midnight counterparts, but not quite as aggressive. Their tenacity to do battle no matter what means they are less likely to be flinched out of using their moves. Their Howl and Roar moves are more effective.</p>
<p>Lycanroc [Midnight] (Rock): Under the influence of the moon, Lycanroc evolves into its midnight form. This form is more wild and aggressive than its midday counterpart, and while not quite as quick or agile as its foe, its rage-based attacks are more effective. They also gain a slightly higher boost to attack when enraged by moves such as Taunt or Swagger. Their hot blooded nature means they are less likely to be lulled to sleep during battle. Their Howl and Roar moves are more effective.</p>
<p>Machamp (Fighting): One of the strongest Pok&#233;mon alive, Machamp can restrain most opponents with two hands and use the other two for something else. Their punching and chopping attacks will deal 1.2x more damage, though Machamp are not adept at using its limbs with great dexterity and may find it difficult to strike smaller opponents, as well as having reduced dexterity limiting their accuracy when using physical attacks at speed. Machamp can lift twice as much for a particular attack than what is normally stated. They wear a power belt, which restricts how much energy they expend. A trainer can order Machamp to adjust the setting to 'high', 'medium' and 'low', adjustment counting as a move. Medium is the default setting and has no effect. High causes them to move 1.2x faster for 1.2x energy and allows them to lift thrice as much for a particular attack than what is normally stated, as opposed to twice as much. Low causes them to move 0.8x faster for 0.8x energy and negates their usual strength bonus. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Machoke (Fighting): Machoke's punch and chop based moves deal 1.1x damage. Machoke can lift twice as much for a particular attack than what is normally stated. They pay for this strength with reduced dexterity and are not as accurate when using physical attacks at speed. They wear a power belt, which restricts how much energy it expends. A trainer can order Machoke to adjust the setting to 'high', 'medium' and 'low', adjustment counting as a move. Medium is the default setting and has no effect. High causes them to move 1.2x faster for 1.2x energy and allows them to lift thrice as much for a particular attack than what is normally stated, as opposed to twice as much. Low causes them to move 0.8x faster for 0.8x energy and negates the usual strength bonus. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Machop (Fighting): The weakest of the Machop line, but not weak Pok&#233;mon-wise by a long shot, Machop's punch and chop based moves deal 1.1x damage. Machop can lift twice as much for a particular attack than what is normally stated. They pay for this strength with reduced dexterity and are not as accurate when using physical attacks at speed. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Magby (Fire): Because they gestate in magma, Magby can stay in lava/hot chemicals indefinitely. They are resistant to moves which induce sleep or drowsiness and will recover more quickly from these conditions. They can also see in the dark. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective. </p>
<p>Magcargo (Fire/Rock): Magcargo can survive in molten lava indefinitely. They can use Acid Armour in lava they way water Pok&#233;mon can use Acid Armor in water (i.e. turn invisible). Their rocky shell provides little defense, unless they have had a good amount of time to cool. Any Pok&#233;mon that comes into contact with a Slugma or Magcargo has a 20% chance of being burned and their bodies can provide illumination. Because of the intense heat radiated by Magcargo, Water based attacks deal only half damage as they evaporate before they can affect it. They do not take extra Water damage for having an 'exposed flame'. They can see in the dark and are inorganic.</p>
<p>Magearna (Steel/Fairy): Being a mechanical Pokemon, Magearna is inorganic. Magearna's movement is stiff but not necessarily slow, and they can curl into a compact orb to allow for much faster movement. They will also take slightly reduced damage while in this form, but may only enter it once per round. Whenever a Pokemon faints while Magearna is active in battle, Magearna will gain a boost to it's Special Attack.</p>
<p>Magikarp (Water): Magikarp have decent speed in the water and can jump quite far out of the water, but are helpless on land. Due to their reputation for ineptitude, foes may not take them seriously and be less eager to attack. They can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Magmar (Fire): Because they gestate in magma Magmar can stay in lava/hot chemicals indefinitely. They have flaming tails and horns, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. They are resistant to moves which induce sleep or drowsiness and will recover more quickly from these conditions. They can also see in the dark.</p>
<p>Magmortar (Fire): Because they gestate in magma, Magmortar can stay in lava/hot chemicals indefinitely. They have flaming tails, shoulders and horns, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. Magmortar's Fire-typed attacks travel faster and are more intensely hot if launched from its arms, with an increased chance to burn when used so. They are resistant to moves which induce sleep or drowsiness and will recover more quickly from these conditions. They can also see in the dark.</p>
<p>Magnemite (Electric/Steel): Magnemite levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are more agile. They are inorganic and can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically in man made environments.</p>
<p>Magneton (Electric/Steel): Magneton levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are much more agile. They are inorganic and can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically in man made environments. Magneton are considered to be one Pok&#233;mon, though their three eyes help them with vision and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal. Damage is distributed equally throughout all three individual Magneton, and thus when one is KOed, all three are.</p>
<p>Magnezone (Electric/Steel): Magnezone levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are more agile. They are inorganic and can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically in man made environments. Magnezone are considered to be one Pok&#233;mon, though their three eyes help them with vision and their Tri Attack is more powerful than normal. </p>
<p>Makuhita (Fighting): Makuhita are slow and lack agility but are sturdy and difficult to knock over. Makuhita have powerful hands and any attacks performed by use of their hands (Arm Thrust, Knock Off, possibly Rock Slide) do 1.1x more damage. This does not apply to fist attacks, such as Mega Punch or Dynamic Punch. Thanks to the thick layer of fat in their skin, Makuhita take 10% less damage from Ice and Fire-type attacks and are resistant to extreme temperatures. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Malamar (Dark/Psychic): Malamar are able to bioluminesce, allowing them to light up a dark area for an extended period of time by using a move. It costs no energy to maintain this light. Their light-based attacks are slightly more potent than normal allowing it to inflict stronger sleep and mental illusions with Hypnosis. They can levitate, and are faster than their previous form. Their arms are long and quite stretchy, allowing them to attack from a distance. They are also fairly able swimmers and can stay underwater as long as any Water type. They can expel ink as a defense, using little energy but at the cost of a move, which can be used to blind opponents.</p>
<p>Mamoswine (Ice/Ground): Mamoswine are large and sturdy, making them difficult to knock over. When they starts charging, they are difficult to stop, and their ramming attacks are more effective than usual. Mamoswine have a large amount of fur, which keeps them warm in otherwise unbearably cold temperatures and slightly reduces damage from Fire and Ice attacks. They have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Despite their size, they are adept at hiding in blizzards and can see through them easily. Being prehistoric, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Manaphy (Water): Manaphy is the spirit of the sea. It can maneuver in the water as well as the best of fliers and levitators can in air, able to propel itself in any direction quickly and with ease. When on land, it levitates a few inches above the ground and is decently agile. It can restore health from clean water or rain once per battle using a move, restoring up to 1/4th of its maximum health. Manaphy is born with a wondrous power that lets it bond with any kind of Pokémon, making moves like Charm and Confide much more effective. Heart Swap, as its signature move, uses far less energy than normal. Manaphy is more adept at using its Acid Armor technique to hide in water than other Pokémon.</p>
<p>Mandibuzz (Dark/Flying): The bones around their waist act as a defensive buffer, giving it a slight boost in defense for all attacks that hit around that area. Being vultures, they are resistant to poisoning. Due to the amount of bones decorating their body, their Bone Rush attack costs slightly less energy. Their frightening decorations cause their intimidation attacks to be more potent.</p>
<p>Manectric (Electric): Manectric are filled with electricity and physical attacks used against them have a 10% chance of dealing slight paralysis to the user. In situations where an electric attack not originating from Manectric are used, there is a 10% chance it will be redirected to them if they are within 10 feet of the attack. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. In its Mega Forme, its fear-inducing attacks are more effective on any Pok&#233;mon that would reasonably be afraid of it. With electrical energy constantly coursing through its body, Manectric is now extremely fast, its speed rivaling that of Electrode. Its body is constantly in a state of Charge, giving it a boost to the speed and power of its electrical attacks.</p>
<p>Mankey (Fighting): Mankey are excellent climbers, allowing them to scale most walls and surfaces and swing from vines and branches with ease, and they can use their tail to grasp objects and ledges. They interpret being stared in the eyes a challenge to their authority. Thus, any eye contact will cause Mankey launch into a berserk rage. They will focus almost exclusively on the offending target to the exclusion of all other concerns unless something else starts to become a bigger problem or gets in the way of their rage. Until its target has fallen Mankey will be extremely emotional and responsive but more vulnerable to confusion. Mankey will also be winded for a few moments after its berserker rage has ended, with longer periods of rage meaning more downtime. A trainer may write a note in their bio stating that their Mankey has been trained not to enter in to the enraged state in this way.</p>
<p>Mantine (Water/Flying): Mantine are fish, thus they are helpless on land but elegant in the water. They can fly quite well, though they are incapable of holding position indefinitely. Whilst they can easily take off from the water, they will have trouble doing so from land. They take slightly less damage from special moves than other Water types.</p>
<p>Mantyke (Water/Flying): Mantyke are fish, thus they are helpless on land but elegant in the water. They can fly quite well, though they are incapable of holding position indefinitely. Whilst they can easily take off from the water, they will have trouble doing so from land. They cannot glide for as long as Mantine. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Maractus (Grass): Maractus have bodies filled with loose seeds and sand, causing them to make noises similar to maracas when it moves. This makes it hard to hide or move silently, but can be used as a move similarly to the rattle of a rattlesnake to intimidate or spook unsuspecting foes. Because they live in the desert, they are immune to the effects of Sandstorms and can see reasonably well in them. They fight more enthusiastically in sandy or dusty areas. Their Ingrain attack heals more health than usual, their draining attacks are more effective than normal and they gain greater benefit from both sun and rain than other Grass-types. They are covered in spikes, so those who attack them with physical attacks will take roughly 25% recoil damage (unless they are particularly hard bodied) and their Needle Arm attack is more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Mareanie (Water/Poison): Mareanie are slow moving Pokemon, preferring to walk along the bottom of the water rather than actively swim. They are able to swim, but are not very proficient, and will easily be overpowered by currents. Mareanie have particularly powerful toxins stored within their body, which allow their Poison type attacks to deal an extra 10% damage to Pokemon suffering from the Poison status. They are also rather sturdy, taking 10% less damage from physical blows.</p>
<p>Mareep (Electric): A Mareep's wool is slightly charged and any Pok&#233;mon not resistant to electricity who comes into physical contact with Mareep has a 10% chance of flinching, subject to diminishing returns. Mareep have the ability to use the balls on their tails as lights. While not as powerful as a Flash attack, they light up the arena without blinding opponents or allies, and doing so takes almost no energy to maintain. It is considered one move for a Mareep to light its tail. This will, however, make it a more obvious target for Pok&#233;mon who can see in dark areas.</p>
<p>Marill (Water/Fairy): A Marill's hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making it more vulnerable to sound-based status moves. Marill may use their tail-balls as a floatation device, making it difficult to force one underwater if it does not wish to do so. Their fur actively repels water, meaning they can swim in even the strongest of currents almost effortlessly, easily escaping traps like Whirlpool. Their tail is flexible and can be extended to improve the reach for moves, and they can use it to aid their Bounce attack, clearing slightly more distance than normal.</p>
<p>Marowak (Ground): A Marowak's face is covered by a skull, which it will not remove willingly.

<p>Marshadow (Fighting/Ghost): Marshadow is a timid creature, and as such is much better at hiding than other Pokemon. It is especially good at utilizing shadows, as Marshadow can vanish into any shadow using a move and can quickly travel using the shadows of objects and other Pokemon, though it is still able to be attacked when it does so. It comes out of the shadows upon using any attack or upon taking damage. Despite usually being solid, Marshadow has no limitations on going into an ethereal state and it can hold its invisible state for a round longer than normal. Its deception based moves are much more potent and effective, able to trick foes with greater ease.

Their techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective. Mawile can see in the dark. In its Mega Forme, Mawile gains a second jaw. The two jaws can be controlled independently of one another, allowing for a great deal of physical manipulation. Mawile's deceptive attacks are also extremely potent in this form, gaining a 15% boost in damage and are likely to trick the foe, even if they've been deceived before.</p>

<p>Mew (Psychic): As the supposed ancestor of all living Pok&#233;mon, Mew is extremely adept in all aspects of battle. Since its cells are essentially specialized stem cells, they allow it to adapt to nearly any situation. It is considered to be familiar with all types and all moves, able to use them as if it were the type of that move (though its energy pools are still limited). The pluripotency of its cells that allow it to use Transform allows it to create temporary physical energy constructs that help it perform moves for which it lacks the anatomy. Additionally, despite being genderless, it can use any gender-based moves on any gendered Pok&#233;mon as if it were the target's preferred gender, but is immune to any moves of this type. Mew is an extremely agile and deft levitator, allowing it to levitate and move through the air as if it were flying.

Chained moves like Double Slap will be faster and more powerful when used by this Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Minior (Rock/Flying): Minior will enter the battle with a shell of rocky material. This shell grants it an 20% higher defense and a resistance against status attacks, but also restricts its mobility somewhat and slows it down.

<p>Monferno (Fire/Fighting): Monferno have flames on their tail. These only go out when sleeping and can be used for illumination and to burn the foe if there is prolonged contact. When threatened, Monferno increase the size of their flame to appear larger than they really are in order to intimidate their opponent.

As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Morelull (Grass/Fairy): Morelull gives off a constant glow which pulses hypnotically. This glow is generally fairly faint but can be intensified and used to illuminate dark areas for no energy. The light is also soothing, making them rather adept at putting foes to sleep. It's powder based attacks are more potent.</p>
<p>Mothim (Bug/Flying): Mothim have a heightened sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Mothim fights more enthusiastically at night. They are adept at concealing themselves in dark environments and are very quiet fliers, making them difficult to track.

<p>Munna (Psychic): Munna thrive on the dreams of others, both Pok&#233;mon and humans. Their sleep-based attacks, including Dream Eater and Nightmare, are more potent than normal. Because they are so skilled at eating dreams, eating Nightmares or other negative dreams will not cause them to lose energy, though they will be uncomfortable and not gain as much energy. They can levitate.</p>
<p>Murkrow (Dark/Flying): Murkrow are symbols of woe amongst Pok&#233;mon and people, particularly when seen at night, so they may make opponents feel uneasy. Murkrow are quiet fliers and can easily evade detection, and are quicker and more agile than their evolutions.</p>
<p>Musharna (Psychic): Musharna thrive on the dreams of others, both Pok&#233;mon and humans. Their sleep-based attacks, including Dream Eater and Nightmare, are more potent than normal. Because they are so skilled at eating dreams, eating Nightmares or other negative dreams will not cause them to lose energy, though they will be uncomfortable and not gain as much energy. Musharna are almost always sleeping, though, much like Abra, they are constantly aware of their surroundings while asleep. This makes them hard to put to sleep against their will.

When Constricting a foe, they will have a profound effect upon their mental state, inflicting them with a more potent Taunt state which requires Extreme damage to break. When Nihilego manage to defeat an opponent, they gain a slight boost to their Special Defence.</p>

They fight more enthusiastically at night.</p>
<p>Nosepass (Rock): Nosepass's nose acts as a magnetic compass and can track the general direction of a Pok&#233;mon by homing in on the electric currents in their body, aiding them in situations where they cannot see the Pok&#233;mon in question. This allows them to more easily locate foes and discover the real Pok&#233;mon in a Double Team set. This of course works most efficiently against Electric-types. Nosepass can see in the dark and are familiar with the Electric type. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Numel (Fire/Ground): Numel are not particularly quick-witted Pok&#233;mon. While some might argue that this makes them similar to Slakoth and Slaking, this is due more to the fact that Numel aren't particularly bright instead of lazy. Because of this, Numel don't often get the initiative and have trouble comprehending more complex orders. However, this same slowness also makes Numel extremely resistant to mentally-affecting abilities and abilities that rely on manipulating emotions, such as Attract, Charm, etc. The flipside to this is that abilities that rely on extreme emotions, such as Rage, are less effective when used by a Numel.</p>
<p>Nuzleaf (Grass/Dark): The leaf on a Nuzleaf's head is sacred to them, and any damage done to it will greatly anger Nuzleaf and cause it to fight more aggressively, focusing their attention against the offender, for the next few rounds. The length of the time for their rage, as well as the extent of their aggression, depends on the extent of the damage, as well as whether it was intentional or not. Nuzleaf will NOT under any circumstance allow their leaf to be damaged, as such, they cannot be ordered to have their leaf damaged to gain the benefits of the rage. Nuzleaf will, regardless of their orders, consider the protection of their leaf top priority. Nuzleaf can recover energy at the rate of a Mega Drain per round by latching onto a tree. Latching and draining counts as one move, counting towards diminishing returns. They are excellent climbers.</p>
<p>Octillery (Water): Octillery have suction cups on their tentacles, which can be used to hold fast to certain surfaces. Thus, if the opponent uses attacks dependent on OctilleryÃ¢â�¬â�¢s weight, Octillery are considered to weigh 200 pounds for the duration of the attack, provided they are touching something they can hold on to. Octillery are fastest in water, though they can move somewhat well on land. They have excellent accuracy and their attacks have a greater chance of hitting. They can see in the dark. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Oddish (Grass/Poison): Oddish smell rather unpleasant and any Pok&#233;mon that smells their odor within three feet have a 10% chance of flinching. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Oddish line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Omanyte (Rock/Water): Omanyte move much more quickly than their evolved brethren, because their shells are lighter. Their shells are hard, taking a bit less damage from attacks. Omanyte move relatively quickly in the water, but somewhat slowly on land. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Omastar (Rock/Water): OmastarÃ¢â�¬â�¢s shells are heavier, and provide 1.2x defense wherever they cover. The sharp spines covering their shell may also cause attacking Pok&#233;mon to suffer small amounts of recoil on physical contact. Omastar move relatively quickly in the water, but somewhat slowly on land. However, they are slower than their unevolved brethren. Their grip is very strong and attacks which involve squeezing the foe with their tentacles will be more effective. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Onix (Rock/Ground): Onix are large Pok&#233;mon and are able to burrow through hard materials such as concrete with their Dig attack easily. They can see in the dark. They have slightly higher physical defence compared to other Rock-types.</p>
<p>Oranguru (Normal/Psychic): Oranguru are extremely focused Pok&#233;mon - it is nearly impossible to break their focus. The fan they hold allows them to project their mental energy more easily, boosting their mentally affecting moves. The fan also allows them a greater degree of control over their Psychic type moves, making them more accurate than normal.</p>
<p>Oricorio [Baile] (Fire/Flying): Oricorio are extremely skilled dancers that have adapted to conditions on the islands from which they hail. All dancing moves they perform are more potent and deal 10% more damage. The Baile Style Oricorio specializes in fiery, passionate dances. Its movements are quite snappy and sharp, making its movements somewhat unpredictable. While they are slightly easier to anger, they also receive greater boost to their attack as a result of angering them.</p>
<p>Oricorio [Pa'u] (Psychic/Flying): Oricorio are extremely skilled dancers that have adapted to conditions on the islands from which they hail. All dancing moves they perform are more potent and deal 10% more damage. The Pa'u Syle Oricorio dances rhythmically and slowly, with an entrancing series of movements. These movements make its distraction, deception and hypnotic moves more effective. While dancing, it is very hard to break its concentration.</p>
<p>Oricorio [Pom-Pom] (Electric/Flying): Oricorio are extremely skilled dancers that have adapted to conditions on the islands from which they hail. All dancing moves they perform are more potent and deal 10% more damage. The Pom-Pom Style Oricorio brim with enthusiasm and are difficult to discourage. Both it and any allies will fight enthusiastically in spite of their surroundings, and their Helping Hand imparts a slightly more potent boost.</p>
<p>Oricorio [Sensu] (Ghost/Flying): Oricorio are extremely skilled dancers that have adapted to conditions on the islands from which they hail. All dancing moves they perform are more potent and deal 10% more damage. The Sensu Style Oricorio is not a Ghost in the traditional sense and cannot change state, but borrows the power of spirits to fuel its dances and attacks, empowering it's curse moves and making opponents more likely to flinch. It moves very carefully and methodically, and is impossible to anger.</p>
<p>Oshawott (Water): Oshawott constantly wield a shell which they use as a weapon, performing slashing attacks with it, and their Razor Shell attack is 1.1x more powerful than usual. The shell is fairly solid and can be used to defend against many physical attacks or to counter some attacks. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Pachirisu (Electric): As a squirrel, Pachirisu is very nimble and climbs well. Their Electric attacks tend to have a blue coloration and have a slightly increased chance to paralyze their targets. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective when used by Pachirisu.</p>
<p>Palkia (Water/Dragon): Palkia is the embodiment of space. As such, it can manipulate space at its will. This allows it to effectively teleport around by "creasing" space. It may also distort space using a move and significant energy to redirect moves, blocking them or sending them in another direction. Palkia has some powers of flight, and while not particularly nimble, it is relatively fast. They also are able to shift between dimensions for a short time using a move, allowing them to go effectively invisible for about a round.</p>
<p>Palossand (Ghost/Ground): Palossand is effectively sand animated by a spirit. Due to this, in arenas without sand, it is fairly immobile (though it can crawl around more easily than Sandygast using its towers as arms), but it can gather up the contents of its body to crawl around if needed. In sandy arenas, it can "swim" in the sand by moving its spirit and shovel around in the sand. While it cannot go under the surface for more than a few moments, it does allow it to more easily move about and make surprise attacks. Though somewhat immobile without sand, it can expand its gaping, tunnel-like mouth to "dodge" attacks using a move. Since its body is made of loose sand, it allows it some unique properties. For one, it can fuel a sandstorm by spinning its shovel and using the sand from its body, allowing it to sustain a Sandstorm with minimal effort, as well as making it much harder to dispel by Pokemon other than Castform. Also, when hit by a Water attack or otherwise made wet, it will have its defense boosted significantly. Finally, it can create trap-style Sand Tombs by using its body, though this makes it slightly more vulnerable As a Ghost type, it can go ethereal for a few seconds, and is unable to be poisoned.</p>
<p>Palpitoad (Water/Ground): The round structures on Palpitoad's sides act as amplifiers, giving Palpitoad a boost to moves that involve sound or vibrations, including moves like Earthquake.</p>
<p>Pancham (Fighting): Pancham are rather playful Pok&#233;mon, although they try their best to maintain a tough facade. They are somewhat more vulnerable to taunting or ridiculing attacks but receive a greater boost in attack from them.</p>
<p>Pangoro (Fighting/Dark): Pangoro chew a branch in their mouths, able to use it to sense the vibrations in the air to locate targets, similarly to a Psychic-type's ability to locate targets. They are quite intolerant of bullying or making fun, and if they or an ally is taunted or provoked, they will be under the effects of the move as well, but will also gain a significant boost in attack.</p>
<p>Panpour (Water): As monkeys, Panpour are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. Although able to release water through their mouth, Water attacks can also be used through their tail, allowing for better accuracy and a wider range of fire. If in or near a source of water, their tail can be used to siphon extra water to slightly reduce the energy use for Water attacks fired from the mouth. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Pansage (Grass): As monkeys, Pansage are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. The foliage on PansageÃ¢â�¬â�¢s head, though somewhat bitter, is invigorating. Once a battle, Pansage can eat it or offer it to an ally, restoring a good amount of energy and refreshing them, causing them to feel less tired. They have two vines hidden in their head foilage that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Pansear (Fire): As monkeys, Pansear are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. The heat generated in PansearÃ¢â�¬â�¢s body is often released through their head, and if worked up, angered or otherwise excited, attacks that utilize the head will deal more damage and have a slight additional chance of a burn. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Paras (Bug/Grass): If there are trees in the arena, Paras may Dig underground and gain a moderate amount of health from the tree roots by sucking nutrients from them. During this, Paras may not attack, though it is underground. They are naturally moist, meaning that they take slightly less damage from Fire attacks. Due to the potent mushrooms affixed to it's back, Paras' spore based attacks will be slightly more dense than usual.</p>
<p>Parasect (Bug/Grass): The mushroom has taken control of the bugÃ¢â�¬â�¢s mind at this stage. The mushroom has a limited awareness, which makes it difficult for Pok&#233;mon to sneak up behind a Parasect, as the mushroom will be able to "see" them. A Parasect will protect its mushroom above all else. If there are trees in the arena, Parasect may Dig underground and gain considerable health from the tree roots by sucking nutrients from them. During this, Parasect may not attack, though it is underground. They are naturally moist, meaning that they take slightly less damage from Fire attacks. Due to the potent mushrooms affixed to it's back, ParasectÃ¢â�¬â�¢s spore based attacks will be significantly more dense than usual.</p>
<p>Passimian (Fighting): Passimian are skilled with balls and other similar objects. They will enter battle with a large, coconut-like berry, which they can use to Fling for significant Fighting-type damage and energy. Their form is impeccable, and they will almost always be able to catch or otherwise retrieve their berry after they throw it. They also have incredible accuracy when throwing objects. They may also channel energy into their berry, allowing them to use their Ball attacks as physical projectiles.</p>
<p>Patrat (Normal): As lookouts, Patrat have extremely keen eyesight, allowing them to see long distances and in fogs, smoke or otherwise obstructing conditions. Their accuracy cannot be lowered. They are adept climbers. Natural pranksters, they use non damaging moves that target the foe faster than usual.</p>
<p>Pawniard (Dark/Steel): Pawniard's bodies have multiple sharp steel blades on them, which they can use for attack or defense. Pok&#233;mon directly attacking Pawniard risk lacerations and 25% recoil damage. Their bladed arms grant them a x1.1 boost to slashing moves, and their precise edge has a chance to leave a vulnerable spot on the stricken area.</p>
<p>Pelipper (Water/Flying): Pelipper can carry up to three small Pok&#233;mon in its beak, as long as their combined weight is within reason, Pok&#233;mon inside Pelipper's beak can still launch attacks from within, however, such attacks will be less accurate. Pelipper cannot have a Pok&#233;mon in its beak as a signature move. Therefore, Tailwind is more beneficial to them and they can easily fight an opposing Tailwind. Pelipper can dive underwater for a short time, though it's not very fast nor able to go very deep.</p>
<p>Persian (Normal): Meowth and Persian can see in the dark, and are well adapted to moving silently so that no one can hear them move. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As a cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. A Persian's Payday attack produces more coins and does more damage than normal. Persian is a proud Pok&#233;mon and thus more susceptible to moves that induce anger.</p>
<p>Persian [Alola] (Dark): Alolan Persian is a proud Pok&#233;mon and thus more susceptible to moves that induce anger. However, their incredibly thick coats leave them with a profound resistance to physical attacks, reducing damage taken from them by 20%. They are also much more crafty than their wild counterparts, and their deception and trickery techniques will be more potent as a consequence Persian can see in the dark, and are well adapted to moving silently so that no one can hear them move. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As a cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. A Persian's Payday attack produces more coins and does more damage than normal.</p>
<p>Petilil (Grass): Petilil emanate a soothing scent constantly that acts much the same way as Sweet Scent. Their effects are potent in close quarters, but quickly lose strength outside of a foot from them. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Petilil line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. Their dancing moves are more effective than normal and they are immune to the disorientating effects of Petal Dance. In bright sunlight, they are more enthusiastic and energetic than usual.</p>
<p>Phanpy (Ground): Their leathery skin acts as treads for when performing a Rollout, thus giving better traction (and accuracy) when using a Rollout attack. Like all elephants, Phanpy are sure-footed, even though they cannot see their own feet.</p>
<p>Phantump (Grass/Ghost): Phantump can levitate. Their body is considered to be ethereal, but the wooden stump is always solid. Being denizens of the forest, their Forest's Curse is slightly more potent. Their Ingrain technique heals more health than usual. In addition, the vines they create using Leech Seed are made of petrified wood, making them much more sturdy than normal, and they are able to control the roots of trees with Grass Knot. They can be poisoned.</p>
<p>Pheromosa (Bug/Fighting): Pheromosa is incredibly fast, moving with a speed which surpasses that of most other Pokemon. Despite their frail appearance, their legs are immensely powerful, and they deal 20% more damage with their kicking attacks. The antennae protruding from Pheromosas head are incredibly sensitive, and allow it to have a perfect image of the surroundings no matter what, similar to psychic vision. Whenever Pheromosa manage to defeat an opponent, they gain a slight boost to their speed.</p>
<p>Phione (Water): Phione are made from pure water, making them slightly resistant to physical attacks. They can restore health from clean water or rain once per battle, restoring up to a Thunderbolt worth of health for no energy cost. They can levitate.</p>
<p>Pichu (Electric): Pichu have loose control of their electric energy, meaning that their Electric attacks will cause minor recoil damage. However, they can stabilise this for the next 5 rounds by using Charge. If they are surprised or startled, they will let out a burst of electricity which does damage equal to Thundershock at a radius of three feet. Pichu have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Pidgeot (Normal/Flying): Pidgeot are some of the fastest common flying Pok&#233;mon and have amazing speed and agility in the air, out flying most Pok&#233;mon. Any wind attack used by a Pidgeot is 1.2x more powerful. They also uses less energy when carrying other Pok&#233;mon and can lift 1.5x the weight that most bird Pok&#233;mon can. In its Mega Forme, its wings grow even more powerful, able to conjure wind attacks in nearly an instant. Its wind attacks are extremely fast to produce, requiring barely a second to produce something even as powerful as a Hurricane. This power also allows it to reach high speeds in very little time. It also has extremely keen aim, making its moves very difficult to dodge. </p>
<p>Pidgeotto (Normal/Flying): Pidgeotto have decent speed and agility in the air and will out fly most fliers that aren't fully evolved. Any wind attack used by a Pidgeotto is 1.1x more powerful.</p>
<p>Pidgey (Normal/Flying): Pidgey will out fly most basic stage fliers and have decent speed and agility in the air. Any wind attack used by a Pidgey is 1.1x more powerful.</p>
<p>Pidove (Normal/Flying): Pidove are not particularly bright Pok&#233;mon and may have some trouble understanding complex orders. However, they are very faithful to their owners and will rarely willingly deviate from orders, making them less vulnerable to moves like Taunt and Swagger. Their physical defence is slightly higher than other bird Pok&#233;mon and cannot be lowered.</p>
<p>Pignite (Fire/Fighting): Pignite are somewhat temperamental Pok&#233;mon and are somewhat easily angered. Attacks fueled by anger are more effective against Pignite. Pignite have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They can release a large amount of smoke or smog from their nose in a short time to hide almost in an instant. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Pikachu (Electric): Pikachu are the most agile of their evolutionary line, though not the fastest. Being able to naturally store electricity within their pouches, their Charge attack is more potent than usual. They have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They cannot use Fly or Pain Split (as Notch-Eared Pichu cannot evolve into Pikachu). In addition to normal Pikachu, there is a special type of Pikachu bred specifically for contests called Cosplay Pikachu. This Pikachu may wear one one of five outfits corresponding to the five contest types, each of which grant Cosplay Pikachu a move it would not normally have (Cool: Rock Star, Meteor Mash; Beauty: Belle, Icicle Crash, Cute: Pop Star, Draining Kiss, Smart: Ph. D, Electric Terrain, Tough: Libre, Flying Press). These costumes are basically indestructible in battle but cannot be taken off at any time either. In contests, they will grant a boost to the PikachuÃ¢â�¬â�¢s corresponding contest appeal type equivalent to that of a Contest Scarf (the effects do not stack, however). Cosplay Pikachu cannot evolve into Raichu but does not have to evolve from Pichu and can be added directly at the same level as Pikachu. Costumes can be changed like Formes and carry the same restrictions.</p>
<p>Pikipek: Pikipek have long, narrow beaks adapted for boring holes in wood. Their pecking attacks are 10% more effective than those of other Pok&#233;mon. They also store seeds in their beak, making their Bullet Seed attack deal slightly more damage.</p>
<p>Piloswine (Ice/Ground): Piloswine have a large amount of fur, which keeps them warm in otherwise unbearably cold temperatures and slightly reduces damage from Fire and Ice attacks. While their vision is obscured by its fur, this makes attacks that blind (such as Flash) weaker and eye-contact attacks (such as Leer) more difficult to execute. They have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They are adept at hiding in blizzards and can see through them easily.</p>
<p>Pineco (Bug): Pineco's movement consists of mostly rolling and thus all their body contact attacks (like Tackle and Take Down) are simple variations of Rollout. Pineco can bind themselves to trees as a move, using the tree bark to add additional armor to their shells, which will increase defense, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to fire attacks. Adding bark happens automatically (though it can be ordered not to), provided Pineco has enough time to strip it and add it without being disrupted. When all usable bark is stripped, Pineco will detach from a tree (they may be ordered to detach earlier, if needed).</p>
<p>Pinsir (Bug): Pinsir's short, stubby legs make it difficult to run long distances. To compensate, their pincers are fairly powerful, and any attack requiring them is 1.2x as powerful as normal. They are familiar with the Fighting type. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage. In its Mega Forme, Pinsir gains the Flying type as well as wings and reasonable flight abilities. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Flying energy, causing them to become Flying typed.</p>
<p>Piplup (Water): Piplup are very proud Pok&#233;mon and will not be discouraged easily. If their attack fails, they will become more energetic and have a 10% chance of getting a slight boost to both attack and special attack. They have a fine layer of down that allows them to swim in cold water comfortably and endure freezing temperatures. They are also familiar with the Flying type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Plusle (Electric): Plusle and Minun share a symbiotic relationship when fighting together. They fight much more enthusiastically and effectively when together. Their Helping Hand attack and all switching moves are faster and more effective than normal. Plusle and Minun are also natural cheerleaders, causing any allied Pok&#233;mon to fight enthusiastically no matter the situation as long as they are on the field. Plusle has slightly greater offences than Minun.</p>
<p>Politoed (Water): While not as good a swimmer as a Poliwrath, a Politoed can jump much farther. Politoed are equally adept on land or in water. Politoed may croak as a move. This has effects identical to Charm against any member of the Poliwag, Tympole, Froakie, and Croagunk in the area. All of the Poliwag family secretes a sort of slime when out of the water, which makes them more slippery and harder to grab, though Politoed is not as slippery as its tadpole counterparts. Though they have lost their transparent skin, their Hypnosis is still more effective.</p>
<p>Poliwag (Water): Poliwag cannot run on land so prefer swimming to walking. They secrete a sort of slime when out of the water, which makes them more slippery and harder to grab. Their bellies are transparent, showing what is actually a spiral of their internal organs. These organs move hypnotically, and can be used to perform sleep-inducing Hypnosis without the use of Psychic energy. This also makes sleep-inducing Hypnosis slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Poliwhirl (Water): Poliwhirl are capable of decent movement on land, though they still prefer the water. They secrete a sort of slime when out of the water, which makes them more slippery and harder to grab. Their bellies are transparent, showing what is actually a spiral of their internal organs. These organs move hypnotically, and can be used to perform sleep-inducing Hypnosis without the use of Psychic energy. This also makes sleep-inducing Hypnosis slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Poliwrath (Water/Fighting): Poliwrath are the best and fastest swimmers of all the Poliwag family, but are just as adept on land as they are in the water. They secrete a sort of slime when out of the water, which makes them more slippery and harder to grab. Their bellies are transparent, showing what is actually a spiral of their internal organs. These organs move hypnotically, and can be used to perform sleep-inducing Hypnosis without the use of Psychic energy. This also makes sleep-inducing Hypnosis slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Ponyta (Fire): Ponyta have flaming manes which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. They can control the intensity of their flames, so that people can ride them without being burned. Any attack a Ponyta executes with their hooves is 1.1x as powerful. Ponyta are extremely fast, if not agile, and their ramming attacks are 1.1x more effective than normal. When using Agility, Ponyta leave flaming trails, which do light fire damage to anything that walks over or stands on them.</p>
<p>Poochyena (Dark): Poochyena have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They also have excellent smell and are able to track their opponent and see which one is the real Double Team clone. They are very agile and adept at dodging and are particularly good at escaping from tight corners. They are quite good diggers and swimmers and deal 1.1x damage with their biting attacks. Their Howl attack is more potent than normal.</p>
<p>Popplio (Water): Popplio is an acrobatic Pok&#233;mon, both on land and in the water. While it favors swimming and is agile and fast in water, its movement on land, while not terribly fast, is still fairly agile. Popplio can form large bubbles that are more stable than average, which it can use to bounce into the air to move about or evade attacks, costing a move to do so. Its bubble-based attacks are 10% more potent and will more easily break through screens or other attacks due to their increased durability. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Porygon (Normal): Porygon are created entirely of programming code. They levitate by default, but are not particularly fast or agile and cannot reach as high as other levitating Pok&#233;mon. They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in manmade environments. They are familiar with the Electric type.</p>
<p>Porygon-Z (Normal): Porygon-Z are created entirely of programming code. Due to data corruption, they have slightly higher offences than other Pok&#233;mon at the cost of lower defences. Porygon-Z are also capable of separating their heads and moving independently of their body (including full 360-degree rotation without having to turn), but the head cannot go beyond or be forced more than half a foot away from its body.They levitate by default, their sleek design and advanced technology making them faster and more agile most levitating Pok&#233;mon. They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in man made environments. They are familiar with the Electric type.</p>
<p>Porygon2 (Normal): Porygon2 are created entirely of programming code. They levitate by default, their sleek design making them faster and more agile than Porygon. They are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in manmade environments. They are familiar with the Electric type.</p>
<p>Primarina (Water/Fairy): Primarina, while not as acrobatic as it's previous evolutions, is still a agile Pokemon, nimble in water and adept at moving on land. They can no longer form bubbles sturdy enough to take their weight, but their voice has developed fully. This makes their sound moves more potent, granting a 20% boost to damage and allowing Sing to work with a quickened pace. Primarina may also charge their Normal typed sound moves with Water energy, causing them to deal Water type damage. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Primeape (Fighting): Primeape are excellent climbers, allowing them to scale most walls and surfaces and swing from vines and branches with ease. They interpret being stared in the eyes a challenge to their authority. Thus, any eye contact will cause Primeape launch into a berserk rage. They will focus almost exclusively on the offending target to the exclusion of all other concerns unless something else starts to become a bigger problem or gets in the way of their rage. Until its target has fallen Primeape will be extremely emotional and responsive but more vulnerable to confusion. Primeape will also be winded for a few moments after its berserker rage has ended, with longer periods of rage meaning more downtime. A trainer may write a note in their bio stating that their Primeape has been trained not to enter in to the enraged state in this way.</p>
<p>Prinplup (Water): Prinplup are very proud Pok&#233;mon and will not be discouraged easily. If their attack fails, they will become more energetic and have a 10% chance of getting a slight boost to both attack and special attack. They have a fine layer of down that allows them to swim in cold water comfortably and endure freezing temperatures. They are also familiar with the Flying type. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Probopass (Rock/Steel): Probopass levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are much more agile. The mini-noses can be controlled freely, allowing Probopass to use punching attacks from a reasonable distance. Their nose acts as a magnetic compass and can track the general direction of a Pok&#233;mon by homing in on the electric currents in their body, aiding them in situations where they cannot see the Pok&#233;mon in question. This allows them to more easily locate foes and discover the real Pok&#233;mon in a Double Team set. This of course works most effectively against Electric-types. Probopass can see in the dark and are familiar with the Electric type. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Psyduck (Water): While Psyduck are perceived to be idiotic, it's a somewhat unwarranted perception. Psyduck actually suffers from a rather distracting headache as a result of its developing mental powers. If irritated, distracted or confused, its headache can worsen. While Psyduck isn't as fast or agile as Golduck is, its psychic abilities become more powerful as its pain increases. The Psyduck family is considered to be familiar with the Psychic type.</p>
<p>Pumpkaboo (Grass/Ghost): Pumpkaboo come in four sizes, Small, Average, Large and Super. The Small size has somewhat less HP than average but is much faster than the larger sizes, where the Super size has a good deal more HP than average, but is very slow. Pumpkaboo's size will carry over when evolving. Pumpkaboo have the ability to create searchlights from their eyes. While not as powerful as a Flash attack, they light up the arena without blinding opponents or allies, and doing so takes almost no energy to maintain. It is considered one move for a Pumpkaboo to light searchlights. They are solid by default, but can become ethereal for a short time to evade attacks. As jack-o-lantern Pok&#233;mon, they are familiar with Fire-typed moves.</p>
<p>Pupitar (Rock/Ground): Pupitar moves mostly through hopping. To compensate, their shell is much tougher, and any physical attacks against them are reduced to 80% strength. A trainer may order Pupitar to eat the soil as a move. Pupitar will eat a mouthful, increasing its health and energy a little. Poisonous soil will have the opposite effect, damaging it instead of healing it. Pupitar can see in the dark. Their bodies are full of sand, and they are able to use the sand to produce Sandstorms, instead of relying on the sand in the arena.</p>
<p>Purrloin (Dark): Purrloin are mischievous and deceptive Pok&#233;mon, using their cuteness and playfulness to distract the foe and strike. Any attacks involving deception or distraction will be more successful. They are well adapted to moving silently. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed.</p>
<p>Purugly (Normal): Despite their size and look, Purugly are very fast Pok&#233;mon and can use their springy tails to bounce like a Spoink, but not terribly agile. They are also fairly intimidating and resistant to intimidation. They can see in the dark and are well adapted to moving silently. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As cats, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. Their tail based attacks are 1.2x more powerful.</p>
<p>Pyroar (Fire/Normal): Pyroar are very proud and protective Pok&#233;mon. Though rage-inducing attacks will be more effective, they will also sharply boost their attack. Any move involving roaring or growling will be more intimidating and more effective when used by Pyroar, even those which would not normally have this effect. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to sound-based status attacks. Their sense of smell is similarly enhanced, allowing them to track foes and detect true foes in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Pyukumuku (Water): Pyukumuku are rather slow, only being able to move by crawling. Their intense mental fortitude means they are also resistant to pain and difficult to interrupt, while also being immune to Taunt and Torment. When they faint, Pyukumuku will launch a final, desperate attack, spewing their innards forward to land a devastating blow to the foe. This will deal Extreme damage, and will ignore all type modifiers. The stricken foe will also be slightly sluggish to react in the following turn due to the disgusting nature of this.</p>
<p>Quagsire (Water/Ground): Quagsire move at a decent clip on land and a respectable pace in the water, though they prefer shallow, slow water to deep, fast currents. They are coated with a slimy substance, which makes them harder to grab and prevents them from being affected by Electric attacks when wet.</p>
<p>Quilava (Fire): Quilava are the middle of the road speed and agility wise in the evolutionary family. They can control whether their dorsal flames are ignited at any one time. When not ignited, they take only x1.5 damage from Water attack. However, they cannot use any fire attacks if their fire is not ignited. Igniting gives them their normal weakness to water and allows them to provide illumination and burn foes if there is prolonged contact. It also allows them to use fire attacks. Igniting does not count as a move, and happens automatically when the Pok&#233;mon is ordered a fire attack. However, de-igniting counts as a move. They will automatically de-ignite if they fall asleep. They have a x1.1 boost to lava based moves. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Quilladin (Grass): Quilladin's entire bodies are covered by a thick, woody coating, giving them a defensive boost against all physical attacks. Their kind and peaceful nature makes their anger-related attacks less effective but also makes anger-based attacks used on them less effective. They have two vines hidden on their heads that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Qwilfish (Water/Poison): Qwilfish are somewhat slow in water and nearly immobile on land. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. In water, Qwilfish may inflate as a move. When inflated, Qwilfish moves more slowly, but has a higher defense, and any enemy that comes into contact with Qwilfish may hit a spike, taking damage equal to Poison Sting (with the same chance of poison). Qwilfish must inflate before firing any of its spikes or use any "spike" attack (Poison Sting, Pin Missile). Their pins are coated with a poison, which have a 10% chance of causing poison. Qwilfish may automatically deflate without using a move.</p>
<p>Raichu (Electric): Raichu are the fastest of their evolutionary line, if not as agile as their previous stage. Being able to naturally store electricity within their pouches, their Charge attack is more potent than usual. They are able to use their tail to channel Electric attacks. Direct contact with the foe using its tail will give a slight boost in the chance of paralysis for the attack and will make paralysis in the contact area far more likely. Raichu have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They cannot use Fly or Pain Split.</p>
<p>Raichu [Alola] (Electric/Psychic): The mysterious influence of Alola has turned Raichu into a strange psychic Pok&#233;mon. Alolan Raichu constantly levitates, using its tail similar to a hoverboard that it uses to float. It is fairly agile whne it floats, and will always remount its tail if it falls off, though this will occur rarely due to their extremely keen balance. Their cheeks release a sweet scent that lowers a Pok&#233;mon's defense if they are within 5 feet of Raichu. Raichu have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They cannot use Fly or Pain Split.</p>
<p>Raikou (Electric): Raikou are extremely fast runners, able to outrun practically any Pok&#233;mon on the ground. A Raikou's Roar attack is more effective than normal. Rain summoned by Raikou is generally very violent and will turn immediately to a thunderstorm. Lightning bolts will rain down for each turn that it is raining, with a 10% chance of striking the foe for good damage.</p>
<p>Ralts (Psychic/Fairy): Ralts's empathic abilities make them very in touch with their opponent. Attacks that deal with the opponents mental state are more effective. Teleporting also requires slightly less energy.</p>
<p>Rampardos (Rock): Rampardos' extremely hard and somewhat pointed skull gives them a 1.2x boost in head-based attacks. However, Rampardos are not very agile. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Rapidash (Fire): Rapidash have flaming manes, which can be used for illumination and may burn foes if there is prolonged contact. They can control the intensity of their flames, so that people can ride them without being burned. Any attack a Rapidash executes with their hooves is 1.2x as powerful. Rapidash are extremely fast, if not agile, and its ramming attacks are 1.2x more effective than normal. When using Agility, Rapidash leave flaming trails, which do light fire damage to anything that walks over or stands on them.</p>
<p>Raticate (Normal): A Raticate's whiskers give it better balance than most Pok&#233;mon. However, if they are cut off, it will slow their speed and agility. Raticate's biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful than usual. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They can also see in the dark.</p>
<p>Raticate [Alola] (Dark/Normal): Raticate in Alola have become rather hefty due to a higher calorie urban diet. While they are slower than normal Raticate, they are harder to knock around. A Raticate's whiskers give it better balance than most Pok&#233;mon. However, if they are cut off, it will slow their speed and agility. Raticate's biting attacks are 1.2x more powerful than usual. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They can also see in the dark. This extends to being able to mask their scent, making their Double Team much more convincing.</p>
<p>Rattata (Normal): A Rattata's biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful than usual. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They can also see in the dark.</p>
<p>Rattata [Alola] (Dark/Normal): A Rattata's biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful than usual. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They can also see in the dark. Alolan Rattata are more adapted to living in urban environments and as a consequence, are adept at hiding. This extends to being able to mask their scent, making their Double Team much more convincing.</p>
<p>Rayquaza (Dragon/Flying): Rayquaza is the guardian of the skies and the custodian of Groudon and Kyogre. Rayquaza's presence in the arena instantly clears the area of any weather effects, leaving it neutral and clear. Any attempt to use weather moves or summon weather will fail. Only Primal Reversions may break its seal on weather effects. Rayquaza is an extremely fast and agile flier. It can fly at altitudes other Pok&#233;mon cannot even imagine to reach without any issue and at top speed. In its Mega Forme, Rayquaza becomes one of the most powerful Pok&#233;mon in existence. Rayquaza requires no Mega Token to undergo its Mega Evolution. In its Mega Forme, all weather will be neutralized, including heavy rain and extreme sunlight, as long as it is on the field. Its presence on the field causes the arena to be enveloped in a powerful jet stream laced with Flying energy, halving the damage done by super effective attacks on all Flying Pok&#233;mon (but only for moves that would be super-effective against Flying Pok&#233;mon).</p>
<p>Regice (Ice): Effectively a living glacier, Regice is always extremely cold. Pok&#233;mon who are not used to the cold will become uncomfortable within 5 feet of Regice. This cold aura also slightly reduces the power of Fire attacks. Being inorganic, Regice cannot be affected by Poison in any way and due to not having a brain as a golem and its singularity of purpose, it also has a resistance to mental effects. Regice is blind, but the gems on its surface provide it with a nearly perfect impression of its surroundings, allowing it to detect foes regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide. Being made of pure ice, as special attacks come in, the translucency of its body refracts the energy and weakens the attacks, especially light based ones.</p>
<p>Regigigas (Normal): Regigigas is the guardian of the Legendary Golems, summoned only by their presence. As a massive golem, it holds immense strength, but its time locked away has caused its strength to go dormant. At the beginning of battle, Regigigas's physical attacks will be 20% less powerful and its speed will be lowered. After 3 rounds, however, its power will be unleashed, giving it 20% more power than normal and allowing it to move with significant speed for its size. Regigigas is blind, but the many eye-like depressions on its surface provide it with a nearly perfect impression of its surroundings, allowing it to detect foes regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide.</p>
<p>Regirock (Rock): Regirock's body can be repaired with rocks, allowing up to a maximum of 10% of its health to be restored this way. Its repairing attempt counts as an attack and can be used multiple times until it reaches the 10% maximum. Being inorganic, Regirock cannot be affected by Poison in any way and due to not having a brain as a golem and its singularity of purpose, it also has a resistance to mental effects. Regirock is blind, but the gems on its surface provide it with a nearly perfect impression of its surroundings, allowing it to detect foes regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide. Regirock's body is constructed of ancient stone, reducing the damage of super effective attacks that hit it somewhat.</p>
<p>Registeel (Steel): Being inorganic, Registeel cannot be affected by Poison in any way and due to not having a brain as a golem and its singularity of purpose, it also has a resistance to mental effects. Registeel is blind, but the gems on its surface provide it with a nearly perfect impression of its surroundings, allowing it to detect foes regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide. Its body is made of an incredibly hard steel alloy and is resistant to slashing or scratching attacks, as well as softening any physical blows that strike it by 50%.</p>
<p>Relicanth (Water/Rock): Though far more at home in the water, Relicanth's lobed fins allow it to stand on land and even move, though slowly, as if they were legs. They can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizable body of water. They are generally slow swimmers, but can move quickly in short bursts for ramming attacks, giving them a small boost. Their rocky heads give them an immunity to recoil from their attacks.</p>
<p>Remoraid (Water): Remoraid are fish Pok&#233;mon and almost helpless on land. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. They are capable of latching on to allied Mantine and firing ranged moves in flight with perfect accuracy due to their symbiotic nature. They have excellent accuracy and their attacks have a greater chance of hitting. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Reshiram (Dragon/Fire): The white half of the mythical Unova Dragon, Reshiram embodies kinetic energy and heat. Reshiram may activate its turbine, increasing the power and speed of its Fire attacks by 20% while decreasing their charge time. Activating its turbine will give it a slight weakness to Water. Reshiram can fly through the air fairly fast and relatively nimbly for its size.</p>
<p>Reuniclus (Psychic): Reuniclus's body is surrounded by a liquid chemically similar in composition to a cell's cytoplasm, acting as a protective buffer from the outside environment. The damaging effects of weather, such as Hail or Sandstorm, will be buffered by this coating of liquid, and statuses, like poison or burn, may be weakened or distributed. Toxic will take an extra turn to set in as it diffuses through this liquid coat. As their brains are a fusion of two, they are more resistant to mentally-affecting attacks. Their arms, despite being primarily composed of this liquid, are actually very firm, strong and prehensile, allowing for powerful attacks and a great ability to throw or smash. They levitate by default.</p>
<p>Rhydon (Ground/Rock): Rhydon are extremely heat-resistant and can survive in hot liquids (such as lava) for extended periods of time. Any ramming attacks they use are more effective, as they will be able to hit the Pok&#233;mon and keep running, adding a little "trampling" damage. They are not great at changing direction or slowing down once up to speed. Electric attacks which are deliberately targeted at its horn have a 5% chance of dealing neutral damage. Any electric attack used in the presence of a Rhydon is 100% accurate, but regardless of where it's aimed, will go toward Rhydon. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Rhyhorn (Ground/Rock): Slung low to the ground, Rhyhorn are excellent at charging and tackling attacks. Any ramming attacks they use are more effective, as they will be able to hit the Pok&#233;mon and keep running, adding a little "trampling" damage. However, they are not great at changing direction or slowing down once up to speed. Electric attacks which are deliberately targeted at its horn have a 5% chance of dealing neutral damage. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Rhyperior (Ground/Rock): Rhyperior can create rocks from their hands for any rock based attack requiring some from the arena. Their charging based attacks do slightly more damage then normal as well. However, they are not great at changing direction or slowing down once up to speed. Their highly thick and resistant hide means that super effective attacks against it deal slightly less damage. They are extremely heat-resistant and can survive in hot liquids (such as lava) for extended periods of time. Electric attacks which are deliberately targeted at its horn have a 5% chance of dealing neutral damage. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Ribombee (Bug/Fairy): Ribombee are slightly larger than their unevolved form but still significantly smaller than most Pok&#233;mon. As such, their physical attacks are slightly weakened. However, they are agile and fairly fast for their size, able to avoid attacks with greater ease. They are also highly sensitive to the energies and auras of other Pok&#233;mon, giving them a constant ability to detect the presence and location of their foes. Due to spending so much time around flowers, their Sweet Scent attack is much more potent, inducing a more profound slowed reaction in the opponent. Riombee's body is covered in pollen, that it can gather up and use in Pollen Balls. Using a move and good energy, it can gather a Pollen Ball and chuck it at a foe or ally, causing an allergic reaction similar to Cotton Spore for foes and a 20% chance of paralysis, or resetting the mental state of allies, as well as shocking them from sleep or drowsiness.</p>
<p>Riolu (Fighting): Riolu have an underdeveloped ability to sense aura. This gives them a vague idea of the opponent's whereabouts, making them more likely to hit a foe when unable to see it. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Rockruff (Rock): Rockruff are very loyal Pok&#233;mon. They are more likely to follow orders of their trainers, even if they consider such orders questionable. They are also quite tenacious and hard to discourage, fighting with increased enthusiasm at night, particularly when the moon is visible. Their howling attacks are more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Roggenrola (Rock): Despite resembling an eye, the artifice on Roggenrola's face is actually an ear, making them effectively blind. However, this ear is extremely sensitive to vibrations both in the earth and the air, allowing them to detect their foe despite any visual obstructions. They are inorganic.</p>
<p>Roselia (Grass/Poison): As a rose plant, Roselia emanate a soothing scent constantly that acts much the same way as Sweet Scent. Its effects are more potent in close quarters, but quickly lose strength. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Budew line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. Their petal-based attacks are slightly more forceful, able to break through resistance with greater ease, but will deal no extra damage.</p>
<p>Roserade (Grass/Poison): As a rose plant, Roserade emanates a soothing scent constantly that acts much the same way as Sweet Scent. Their effects are more potent in close quarters, but quickly lose strength. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Budew line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. Roserade's special attacks deal slightly more damage than normal for no additional energy. Their petal-based attacks are significantly more forceful, able to break through resistance with greater ease, but will deal no extra damage.</p>
<p>Rotom (Electric/Ghost): Rotom are considered permanently in 'plasma' state, which counts as the ethereal state, and cannot achieve the solid, ethereal or invisible states. However, they can pass through walls in this 'plasma' state and are able to occupy objects for a much longer time than other Ghosts. While occupying an object on the battlefield, they will take full damage from attacks if that object is hit with attacks. Despite these abilities, Rotom cannot stay in walls, floors, or other significant surfaces for any longer than the typical ghost. Despite being locked out of the physical state, they take only 10% extra damage from special moves. Rotom are very fast and able to turn corners sharply and instantly. Rotom levitate by default in their natural forme. Rotom may change 'formes' and bond itself more permanently with an object, thus changing its moves, abilities, typing and appearance (see Ghost Information for more details). While in these formes, Rotom loses its Ghost typing but is considered familiar with the type. Regardless of forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments.</p>
<p>Rotom [Cut Forme] (Electric/Grass): In this Forme, Rotom has possessed a lawnmower, having bonded with its electric motor. This Forme is just slightly slower than Fan Rotom, but can equal or overcome its speeds on the ground. While it can levitate, it prefers to travel along the ground, where it can use its wheels to build high speeds. Like the Fan Forme, it has a wide turning radius, even at low speeds, but it can accelerate to high speeds in a very short time. When levitating, it is unable to build or maintain this speed and cannot levitate higher than five feet. In this Forme, it charges its attacks from the hopper in the back, releasing them from its toothy mouth. This allows it to generate energy attacks from a protected point, but will leave it vulnerable for a short time when firing the attack. Attacks that hit the inner portion of the appliance will deal slightly more damage than normal. In this Forme alone, Rotom is capable of using Leaf Storm. Regardless of Forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments. They are familiar with the Ghost type.</p>
<p>Rotom [Fan Forme] (Electric/Flying): In this Forme, Rotom has possessed an electric table fan, having bonded with its electric motor. This Forme is only slightly larger than Heat Rotom, and is the fastest, rivaling the unbonded Rotom in speed. Its levitation is more akin to flight, using a combination of its natural levitation and propulsion generated by its fan to move very fast through the air with a high flight ceiling of nearly twenty feet. However, due to the limited turning ability of the fan, it is unable to turn sharply at even moderate speeds. While unlike its other Formes, it has no protected charging site, it is able to charge in front of its fan and use a burst of air to propel the attack forward. This gives it a higher speed, making it more difficult to evade and easier to surprise with. In this Forme alone, Rotom is capable of using Air Slash. Regardless of Forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments. They are familiar with the Ghost type.</p>
<p>Rotom [Frost Forme] (Electric/Ice): In this Forme, Rotom has possessed a refrigerator, having bonded with its electric motor. This is the largest Forme, being fairly bulky. While it can levitate, it has a low flight ceiling of only two feet and moves primarily through erratic hopping and short bursts. This Forme is neither fast nor agile, but its large and well-insulated frame give it a slight resistance against all attacks. In this Forme, Rotom fires its attacks from behind the refrigerator doors. This allows it to generate energy attacks from a protected point, but will leave it vulnerable for a short time when firing the attack. Attacks that hit the inner portion of the appliance will deal slightly more damage than normal. In this Forme alone, Rotom is capable of using Blizzard. Regardless of Forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments. They are familiar with the Ghost type.</p>
<p>Rotom [Heat Forme] (Electric/Fire): In this Forme, Rotom has possessed an electric oven, having bonded with its electric motor. This is the smallest of all the formes, and is somewhat slower than the Fan Forme and Cut Forme and the most agile, only somewhat slower and less agile than the untransformed Rotom. Its tendrils are shaped like mitts and are semi-solid, which give it a limited ability to manipulate objects but it has a poor grasping ability. The oven door is its primary energy release point where it unleashes its attacks. This allows it to generate energy attacks from a protected point, but will leave it vulnerable for a short time when firing the attack. Attacks that hit the inner portion of the appliance will deal slightly more damage than normal. In this Forme alone, Rotom is capable of using Overheat. Regardless of Forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments. They are familiar with the Ghost type.</p>
<p>Rotom [Wash Forme] (Electric/Water): In this Forme, Rotom has possessed a washing machine, having bonded with its electric motor. This is the second largest Forme, being rather bulky. While it can levitate, it has a low flight ceiling of only three feet and moves primarily through erratic hopping and short bursts. While fairly slow, it is relatively agile, allowing it to make short, quick evasive movements. In this Forme, Rotom has two firing points. The first and primary is the pipe at its side, from which it fires its Hydro Pump. Attacks fired from the pipe allow for faster firing and better aim. The second is from its door. This allows it to generate energy attacks from a protected point, but will leave it vulnerable for a short time when firing the attack. Attacks that hit the inner portion of the appliance will deal slightly more damage than normal. In this Forme alone, Rotom is capable of using Hydro Pump. Regardless of Forme, Rotom are inorganic and fight most enthusiastically in urban environments. They are familiar with the Ghost type.</p>
<p>Rowlet (Grass/Flying): As owls, the Rowlet line are the quietest fliers amongst Pok&#233;mon, almost inaudible as they fly. Rowlet can see in the dark, but fight with equal enthusiasm at all times of day. They can rotate their heads 180 degrees around, allowing them to see in all directions. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Rufflet (Normal/Flying): Rufflet are extremely confident Pok&#233;mon and are difficult to intimidate or beguile. Attacks using fear or intimidating tactics are much less effective on Rufflet.</p>
<p>Sableye (Dark/Ghost): While Sableye are usually solid, they can go invisible for a short amount of time, though the glint of their eyes remains visible to a keen eye. Sableye can also go ethereal for a few seconds to lessen damage from physical attacks. They cannot levitate at all but are excellent climbers, possessing dexterous limbs and a strong grip. Due to Ghost not providing immunity, they are considered weak to the Fighting type. Due to their keen eyesight, Sableye's accuracy cannot be lowered. In its Mega Form, Sableye dons a giant red ruby, using it to block attacks. The gem is rather large and heavy, and can be used to defend against attacks. Using a move, it use it to absorb energy from an attack, but due to its connection to the gem, it still takes 50% damage. It also has reflective properties, reflecting light from light-based attacks.</p>
<p>Salamence (Dragon/Flying): Though large and slow on land, Salamence are very fast in the air and prefer to fly rather than walk using their large wings. They are very intimidating Pok&#233;mon and their fear based attacks are more effective. Salamence can see in the dark. In its Mega Forme, Salamence becomes an extremely powerful flier, able to reach extremely high speeds. Its body is highly streamlined, allowing it to reach high speeds with little effort. Its wings have a blade-like property, making its wing moves x1.2 more effective. In addition, when performing XX or NO moves, they may choose to cloak them in an aura of Flying energy, causing them to become Flying typed.</p>
<p>Salandlit (Poison/Fire): Sandalit releases poisonous gasses from the tip of its tail, as well as its Fire attacks. The gasses it releases have a sweet smell, and are also quite enticing in spite of their toxicity, which will make Pok&#233;mon caught in their gaseous moves less likely to react poorly to the attack. Salandit also can release a strange pheromone when using Attract that is strangely effective on all Pok&#233;mon and will Attract them in spite of their physical differences.</p>
<p>Salazzle (Poison/Fire): Salazzle releases poisonous gasses from the tip of its tail, as well as its Fire attacks. The gasses it releases have a sweet smell, and are also quite enticing in spite of their toxicity, which will make Pok&#233;mon caught in their gaseous moves less likely to react poorly to the attack. Salazzle also can release a strange pheromone when using Attract that is strangely effective on all Pok&#233;mon and will Attract them in spite of their physical differences. As their poisons have matured on evolution, they are able to poison Pokemon of the Steel and Poison typing, irrespective of the mechanism.</p>
<p>Samurott (Water): Samurott are extremely adept with the many sharp shell blades they wield on their body, able to use their long horn, tail and two sword shaped shell plates on their forefeet to attack. Due to their more developed armor and weapons, they takes slightly less damage from attacks that strike their shells and will deal x1.2 damage with slashing and piercing attacks. Despite typically standing on all fours, they can easily fight on two legs, especially when wielding their swords. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Sandile (Ground/Dark): Sandile have a dark membrane covering their eyes, acting like sunglasses to protect them from bright light and sandstorms. They are somewhat resistant to light-based attacks as a result and can see well in bright sunlight. As crocodile Pok&#233;mon, their biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful. However, their jaw muscles are meant for clamping down, not opening up: most Pok&#233;mon can easily keep them shut with their own hands.</p>
<p>Sandshrew (Ground): Sandshrew fight more enthusiastically sandy or dusty areas. Their Defense Curl technique will protect them more than most Pok&#233;mon and they are able to bounce when rolled up, which reduces damage they might receive from heavy impacts and may be used to travel. Sandshrew can see in the dark and have bodies full of sand, letting them produce Sandstorms without relying on the sand in the arena.</p>
<p>Sandshrew [Alola] (Ice/Steel): Alolan Sandshrew have adapted to a frigid, mountainous climate. In this state, it can no longer curl into a ball like wild-type Sandshrew due to the rigidity of its icy shell. However, its shell grants it a 10% boost to its Defense. Its claws have now adapted to navigating icy climates, which means that it is quite surefooted and can walk easily even on slippery or uneven surfaces. These developed claws also boost its claw based attacks by 10%. Sandshrew can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Sandslash (Ground): Sandslash have powerful claws, boosting claw based attacks by 20% and making them excellent diggers. While not 'bouncy' in Defense Curl, they are spiky and any Pok&#233;mon which come into physical contact with them will take minor damage when they are so curled. Sandslash can see in the dark and have bodies full of sand, letting them produce Sandstorms without relying on the sand in the arena. They fight more enthusiastically in sandy or dusty areas.</p>
<p>Sandslash [Alola] (Ice/Steel): Alolan Sandslash have adapted to a frigid, mountainous climate. Their spines have now been replaced with large, hardened icicles. This prevents them from curling into a ball like wild-type Sandslash. However, its shell grants it a 20% boost to its Defense. Its claws have now adapted to navigating icy climates, which means that it is quite surefooted and can walk easily even on slippery or uneven surfaces. Sandslash have powerful claws, boosting claw based attacks by 20%. Sandslash can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Sandygast (Ghost/Ground): Sandyghast is effectively sand animated by a spirit. Due to this, in arenas without sand, it is fairly immobile, but it can gather up the contents of its body to crawl around if needed. In sandy arenas, it can "swim" in the sand by moving its spirit and shovel around in the sand. While it cannot go under the surface for more than a few moments, it does allow it to more easily move about and make surprise attacks. Though somewhat immobile without sand, it can expand its gaping, tunnel-like mouth to "dodge" attacks using a move. Since its body is made of loose sand, it allows it some unique properties. For one, it can fuel a sandstorm by spinning its shovel and using the sand from its body, allowing it to sustain a Sandstorm with minimal effort. Also, when hit by a Water attack or otherwise made wet, it will have its defense boosted slightly. Finally, it can create trap-style Sand Tombs by using its body, though this makes it slightly more vulnerable. As a Ghost type, it can go ethereal for a few seconds, and is unable to be poisoned.</p>
<p>Sawk (Fighting): Sawk are quite skilled in the forms of Karate and constantly practices their technique in chops and kicks and other "direct" maneuvers. Therefore, all attacks involving punches, kicks, or chops gain a solid boost in power.</p>
<p>Sawsbuck (Normal/Grass): Sawsbuck's appearance changes with the seasons, their body changing to Pink in the Spring, Green in the Summer, Orange in the Autumn, and Brown in the Winter (this form can be determined by the user, but some environments that are clearly "wintry" or "summery" may trigger this change). Being so intrinsically linked with the natural world means that their Natural Gift attack will deal significantly more damage than normal, and will be less subject to diminishing returns than normal. Any attack they execute with their hooves or antlers is 1.2x as powerful, and their Horn Leech attack heals them for more health than usual.</p>
<p>Scatterbug (Bug): Scatterbug are covered in a layer of fine powder that they use to attack enemies. If Scatterbug are attacked directly, there is a chance that the foe will inhale some of this powder, which will induce mild paralysis.</p>
<p>Sceptile (Grass): Thanks to the small hooks on their feet, Sceptile are able to scale most vertical surfaces. Sceptile cannot be intimidated easily, and are therefore more resistant to fear-inducing attacks. Their slashing attacks are 1.2x more powerful. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health. In its Mega Forme, it becomes Grass/Dragon type and adopts a number of new traits. Firstly, it may use its tail as a missile of sorts, firing it at foes in order to use physical Grass moves at a distance, or to augment moves such as Leaf Storm. Firing moves this way increases their power by x1.2. Mega Sceptile must wait one round to regenerate its tail before it can perform moves this way again. Mega Sceptile's anatomy also becomes somewhat conductive to electricity, drawing in Electric attacks.</p>
<p>Scizor (Bug/Steel): Scizor are not as fast or agile as Scyther and are not true fliers. Instead, they glide and hover. If needed to, however, they are able to fly for short distances, and their claws allow them to grab and climb relatively smooth surfaces. Their powerful claws also give them a 20% boost to any attack involving them. They have slightly higher defences than other Bug-types. In its Mega Forme, its saw-like claws give any claw attacks greater cutting power, giving them a chance to inflict sore, weakened spots. Its lighter frame and fuller wings allow it to travel with the speed and agility of a Scyther, as well as giving it equivalent flight abilities.</p>
<p>Scolipede (Bug/Poison): The arm-like extensions on their neck are actually spines that seep poison. Physical attacks used with or that hit these spines have a chance of causing light poisoning (about 10%, does not stack with any poison chance in a move). Thanks to the adaptation of their preevo, their poison also has a 5% chance of localized paralysis if foes make contact.</p>
<p>Scrafty (Dark/Fighting): The yellow portion around their lower body and their neck that resemble pants and a hood are actually a shed skin which is very thick and rubbery. This skin can be used as defense, reducing damage from attacks when pulled over their torso or head. As Pok&#233;mon found around urban areas, they somewhat more resistant to Fairy attacks despite their typing.</p>
<p>Scraggy (Dark/Fighting): The yellow portion around their lower body which resemble pants are actually a shed skin which is very thick and rubbery. This skin can be used as defense, reducing damage from attacks when pulled up over their torso. As Pok&#233;mon found around urban areas, they somewhat more resistant to Fairy attacks despite their typing.</p>
<p>Scyther (Bug/Flying): Scyther are very fast and agile in the air and can use slashing attacks with daunting speed, granting them a 10% boost to such attacks. They are skilled at using weaker, faster blows, making all moves of Good or lower damage slightly more powerful.</p>
<p>Seadra (Water): Seadra are very fast and agile in the water. Like Horsea, they can only hop on land and they easily knocked over. They can see in the dark. They are natural sharpshooters, possessing much better accuracy than other Pok&#233;mon. Contact with their spiny fins will hold a 10% chance to cause the attacker to become poisoned.</p>
<p>Seaking (Water): Seaking are excellent swimmers, but are helpless on land. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. They can swim against incredibly powerful currents and are much more likely to get out of attacks like Whirlpool. Their Waterfall attack takes half the normal energy to perform and attacks made using their horn are 1.2x more powerful. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Sealeo (Water/Ice): Sealeo have rotund bodies which allow them to gain speed and momentum very quickly with Rollout. They move primarily by rolling or sliding when on land but prefer to swim if possible. If the floor is slippery like an Ice field, they can maneuverable easily using their flippers and tail. They are highly resistant to freezing temperatures and remain nimble in the coldest waters where other Pok&#233;mon might be numbed. They are very agile swimmers, generally. They can easily conceal themselves in snowy and icy environments. They are able to hold objects on their nose, allowing them to manipulate objects and use them in attacks. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Seedot (Grass): Seedot can recover energy at the rate of Absorb per round by latching onto a tree. Latching and draining counts as one move, counting towards diminishing returns, and Seedot is easy to remove by force, able to be knocked off by even a sufficient wind.</p>
<p>Seel (Water): Seel can move on land but, being slow and awkward, they prefer to swim if they can. If the floor is slippery like an Ice field, Seel can manoeuvre easily using its flippers and tail. They also are very agile swimmers. They are highly resistant to freezing temperatures and remain nimble in the coldest waters where other Pok&#233;mon might be numbed. They can easily conceal themselves in snowy and icy environments. They can see in the dark. The horn atop their head will cause ramming attacks to deal slightly more damage.</p>
<p>Seismitoad (Water/Ground): The lump-like structures on Seismitoad's body act as amplifiers, giving Seismitoad a boost to moves that involve sound or vibrations, including moves like Earthquake. Also, using a move, Seismitoad can cause their lumps to vibrate, giving a slight boost to their next physical attack. They may sweat poison out of their pores as a move and are familiar with the Poison type. Any Pok&#233;mon not resistant to Poison who comes into physical contact risks being poisoned. The poison stays on unless it is somehow washed off. Seismitoad are immune to their own poison produced by this method.</p>
<p>Sentret (Normal): Sentret, when not moving, will stand on their tails if possible, which gives them a better view of their surroundings. This also reduces the damage they take from Earthquake and similar moves, as well as reducing the damage they take from electric attacks a bit (as the electricity goes through their tail to the ground). They are also excellent at digging, able to burrow faster than most Pok&#233;mon. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Serperior (Grass): Serperior are very royal and intimidating Pok&#233;mon and are difficult to discourage or scare. If their stats would normally be lowered for any reason, they experience only half the drop. Their long, sinuous bodies, while not allowing for the speed and agility of their lower forms, allow them to bind foes with ease. Their body and coloring allow them to easily hide amongst trees and grass and their Leaf Tornado attack is faster and more disorientating to its targets. Like Servine, the two vines near their neck can be used for attack or manipulation of objects. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Servine (Grass): Servine, as a young snake, are fairly swift and agile Pok&#233;mon. Their body and coloring allow them to easily hide amongst trees and grass and their Leaf Tornado attack is faster and more disorientating to its targets. They have two vines that stem from their neck. Since their hands are much less prehensile than their preevolutionÃ¢â�¬â�¢s, they utilize the vine-like extensions around their neck to manipulate items and foes, which can extend and retract to attack or grasp. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Seviper (Poison): Seviper goes into a rage whenever on a battlefield at the same time as Zangoose, will only follow orders to attack Zangoose, and will ignore any other orders. If not given any orders involving Zangoose, they will automatically attack using random physical attacks. Because of this rivalry, they take slightly less damage from slashing attacks. They also deal 1.2x damage with tail based attacks.</p>
<p>Sewaddle (Bug/Grass): Sewaddle are dressed in a wrapping of leaves, allowing them to more easily hide amongst trees and bushes than other Grass-types. If their clothing is shed willingly (using a move) or destroyed, they will automatically craft a new one out of nearby foliage. Shedding can remove externally applied statuses like burns, toxic sludge or spore attacks. Their silk makes their String Shot and similar attacks stronger than usual. Like a Spinarak, they can use this to pull themselves from place to place more quickly without it counting as a move. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Sharpedo (Water/Dark): Any Pok&#233;mon that strikes Sharpedo with a physical attack will suffer 25% recoil damage from Sharpedo's rough skin, unless their bodies are particularly hard. Sharpedo are excellent swimmers and will be faster and more agile than most Pok&#233;mon in the water. As a shark, Sharpedo's biting attacks are more effective, dealing 1.2x more damage than usual. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. In its Mega Forme, Sharpedo becomes streamlined and even more aggressive than before, able to reach high speeds in the water. Its jaws are extremely strong, making it extremely difficult to shake them when they've bitten down. Their razor-like teeth will inflict continuous damage as long as they're clamped down, at the rate of good damage per round for good energy.</p>
<p>Shaymin (Grass): Shaymin is connected directly to all plants and flowers. It is able to cause flowers to spontaneously grow in any environment. The air around Shaymin is extremely pure and, using a move, it can almost instantly remove pollutants from the air. It can curl up in a ball to hide in almost any green area, making it difficult to detect. Shaymin can manipulate any plant life in the arena a la Grass Knot to ensnare foes or bloc attacks. Shaymin's alternate Forme, the Sky Forme, may be changed through Squad Submissions. In Sky Forme, Shaymin becomes a deer-like creature, adopting a Grass/Flying type. Although not particularly fast, it makes up for it with levitation-like flight, quite agile in the air and not requiring any sort of powered flight to stay aloft. In this Forme, it retains its purification abilities, though its bright colors make it hard to hide.</p>
<p>Shedinja (Bug/Ghost): Shedinja are largely solid, but can achieve ethereal for short periods of time. They levitate by default. Unlike the games, Shedinja are not immune to all neutral and resisted attacks. They count as being doubly resistant to all non super effective attacks in the same way that a Dragonite type resists Grass type moves. Super effective moves affect them as normal. Shedinja have 3/4 of the health that a normal Pok&#233;mon has. They are immune to being poisoned.</p>
<p>Shelgon (Dragon): A Shelgon's body is covered by a tough, bone-like shell. Physical attacks will deal only 80% damage. Shelgon is slow, but their Rollout attack is as fast as any other Pok&#233;mon and deals 1.2x damage. Shelgon can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Shellder (Water): Shellder lack legs, so their movement on land consists of hopping a few feet at a time. While swimming, Shellder open and close their shell to move through the water. A Shellder's shell is hard, reducing the damage from all attacks. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water. The most vulnerable spot of a Shellder is its face, where it will take a little more damage than usual. They can see in the dark. Their Icicle Spear, Spike Cannon and Rock Blast attacks are slightly more powerful than usual, creating a greater number of projectiles and firing them with greater precision and accuracy.</p>
<p>Shellos (Water): Shellos have two different forms, although they are not different from each other other than looks. Shellos move at a decent speed on land, and a respectable pace in the water, though they prefer shallow, slow water to deep, fast currents. They are coated with a slimy substance, which makes them harder to grab. They are also able to stick to the ground. Any weight attack used against them will when stuck will have them considered to be double their weight. This stickiness also allows it to scale some vertical surfaces.</p>
<p>Shelmet (Bug): A Shelmet's shell is hard, reducing the damage from all attacks. The most vulnerable spot of a Shelmet is their face, where they will take a little more damage than usual. They move mostly by hopping but can shuffle with their small legs to move. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Shieldon (Rock/Steel): Shieldon's face plates are thick and extremely sturdy. Physical hits done to them will deal only 80% damage. Charging attacks and headbutts are 10% more effective. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Shiftry (Grass/Dark): Shiftry are quite adept jumpers and excellent climbers. They are also very agile and are adept at attack evasion. Their wind-based attacks are more powerful than normal and their interruption attacks are much more effective than normal. They can recover energy at the rate of a Giga Drain per round by latching onto a tree. Latching and draining counts as one move, counting towards diminishing returns.</p>
<p>Shiinotic (Grass/Fairy): Shiinotic gives off a constant glow which pulses hypnotically. This glow is generally fairly faint but can be intensified and used to illuminate dark areas for no energy. The light is also soothing, making them rather adept at putting foes to sleep. Alternatively, using a move, Shiinotic may pulsate this light erratically, causing foes to become confused. It's powder based attacks are more potent.</p>
<p>Shinx (Electric): Shinx's hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of making them more vulnerable to sound-based status attacks. Their sense of smell is similarly enhanced, allowing them to track foes and detect true foes in a Double Team. They have excellent eyesight.</p>
<p>Shroomish (Grass): Shroomish's spores and powders are somewhat more effective and spread in denser clouds than usual. Shroomish are resistant to being afflicted with status moves.</p>
<p>Shuckle (Bug/Rock): Shuckle have extremely high defense, making them difficult to harm unless they are hit somewhere other than their shell. However, they are very weak and their attacks do less damage than normal. They can move around easily within their shell and surprise foes by attacking from an unexpected angle.</p>
<p>Shuppet (Ghost): Shuppet are nearly always solid, but can become ethereal or invisible for short periods of time. They levitate by default. Their Curse attack only cuts half the normal health it normally would for other Ghost types, but the target will take the damage it would have taken if Shuppet had sacrificed the normal amount. Shuppet's Curse does not fade away at all if Shuppet is KOed or far from their target. They resist moves which induce sleep and will wake up faster than usual when put to sleep against their will. If another Pok&#233;mon makes contact with them using a move, there is a 20% chance that that move will be disabled for a period of three rounds. They are immune to being poisoned.</p>
<p>Sigilyph (Psychic/Flying): Sigilyph don't actually fly. They levitate by default, with a higher flight ceiling and greater speed and agility than most levitating Pok&#233;mon. Sigilyph do not take damage from any weather conditions or as a result of any statuses inflicted.</p>
<p>Silcoon (Bug): Silcoon are almost completely immobile and move only when attacking. They move mostly by hopping and can latch on to trees and branches to stabilise themselves. Their Harden is much more effective than normal and they are slightly resistant to all attacks.</p>
<p>Silvally (Normal): Silvally is the fully realized form of Type: Null, shedding its helmet once it meets a trainer it trusts. When given a certain set of tokens, its type will change. Its signature attack, Multi-Attack, will also be of the type that it becomes. The token it holds cannot be stolen or tricked from Silvally and it cannot Fling or otherwise get rid of its token. Despite taking on different typing, Silvally will not benefit from the full Species Characteristic of that type due to its unstable nature, although it will have infinite type energy of it's primary typing. Silvally is quite fast and agile, and is also quite a fast swimmer. While it cannot properly "fly", it can jump very high and even higher in its Flying form.</p>
<p>Simipour (Water): As monkeys, Simipour are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. Although able to release water through their mouth, Water attacks can also be used through their tail, allowing for better accuracy and a wider range of fire. If in or near a source of water, their tail can be used to siphon extra water to slightly reduce the energy use for Water attacks fired from the mouth. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Simisage (Grass): As monkeys, Simisage are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. The foliage on SimisageÃ¢â�¬â�¢s head, though somewhat bitter, is invigorating. Once a battle, Simisage can eat it or offer it to an ally, restoring a good amount of energy and refreshing them, causing them to feel less tired. Simisage are also somewhat temperamental and can be somewhat easily provoked. They have two vines hidden in their head foilage that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Simisear (Fire): As monkeys, Simisear are quite nimble and deft, able to navigate trees and branches with ease. The heat generated in SimisearÃ¢â�¬â�¢s body is often released through their head and tail, and if worked up, angered or otherwise excited, attacks that utilize the head or tail will deal more damage and have a slight additional chance of a burn. Despite not being starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they go below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Skarmory (Steel/Flying): Skarmory are used to living in harsh environments so piercing or scratching attacks do less damage than normal against them. Their wings also provide slight resistance against physical attacks when tucked at their side. The undersides of their wings are sharp, granting them a 1.2x boost if used to attack.</p>
<p>Skiddo (Grass): Skiddo are placid domesticated Pok&#233;mon, raised by humans as mounts. They are able to charge in one direction at fairly high speed and can easily clear low ridges and jump small heights without any reduction in speed. Smaller Pok&#233;mon can mount Skiddo and use it as transport without it suffering any speed reductions. They can scale sheer surfaces with greater ease than most Pok&#233;mon. Being goats, their ramming attacks are slightly more powerful than normal. They have two vines that stem from their neck.</p>
<p>Skiploom (Grass/Flying): Skiploom find it slightly more difficult to get in the air than their previous form. However, they are much better fliers once they are airborne and require less of a breeze to stay afloat. They benefit from bright sun more than most Grass-types. Additionally, they are immune being afflicted with a status effect while bright sun is in effect.</p>
<p>Skitty (Normal): Techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective when used by Skitty. They prefer to use their tail for slapping and similar attacks. They are able climbers and have excellent poise and balance. As a cat, they will usually land on their feet, and can slip through gaps that might seem too thin at first glance with little drop in speed. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Skorupi (Poison/Bug): Skorupi are adept at digging and can stay underground for longer than other non-Grounds. Their tails are also fairly adept at grabbing and manipulating objects.</p>
<p>Skrelp (Poison/Water): Despite being a Water-type, Skrelp are rather mediocre swimmers and cannot move with much speed or agility in the water. Instead, they prefer to hide, able to easily camouflage themselves as rotting kelp. The poisonous fluids secreted by Skrelp are tinged with acid, making all poison attacks have a slight corrosive effect, similar to but not as potent as Acid Spray.</p>
<p>Skuntank (Poison/Dark): Skuntank smell absolutely horrible. Any Pok&#233;mon within five feet of them have a 20% chance of flinching and Pok&#233;mon within three feet will experience blurred vision and a slight reduction in attack and special attack. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Stunky line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. They have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team.</p>
<p>Slaking (Normal): Slaking are quite lazy and unmotivated. They are unlikely to react to attacks unless directly ordered to do so. In a dire situation where it seems unlikely Slaking can win, they might lose motivation and do what they want. Slaking are very strong, however, and store up energy. Physical attacks deal slightly more damage in any round immediately after a round in which they use less than significant energy. When using Slack Off and Rest, they gain more energy than usual. They are excellent climbers. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Slakoth (Normal): Slakoth are quite lazy and unmotivated. They are unlikely to react to attacks unless directly ordered to do so. In a dire situation where it seems unlikely Slakoth can win, they might lose motivation and do what they want. When using Slack Off and Rest, they gain more energy than usual. They are also are excellent climbers.</p>
<p>Sliggoo (Dragon): Sliggoo are slow and slimy, but also rather soft and squishy, taking 90% damage from physical attacks. Though they appear to have eyes, they are actually blind, having lost their sight upon evolution. Instead, they use antennae as a radar system, allowing them to detect foes regardless of optical illusions or attempts to hide. Being natural swamp dwellers, they are more comfortable in wet environments.</p>
<p>Slowbro (Water/Psychic): Slowbro have a slow reaction time and will experience a short delay when affected by pain or interrupting moves. They will generally take longer than usual to implement their orders and moves around quite slowly. However, this does not make them unintelligent. They have a high resistance to moves which affect its mental state such as Supersonic or Attract. A Slowbro and its Shellder share a symbiotic relationship: the Shellder acts as a second pair of eyes for the Slowbro. A Slowbro has a higher defense than a Slowking, but a lower attack. In its Mega Forme, Slowbro becomes completely enveloped by its Shellder, which acts as armor, decreasing damage from physical attacks by 25%. In this Forme, Slowbro moves primarily by bouncing, able to balance itself well on its tail. Its mobility is reasonably adept despite its unconventional form of movement. </p>
<p>Slowking (Water/Psychic): Due to the nature of their evolution, Slowking do not have Slowpoke's slow reactions. However, they still move quite slowly. They have a high resistance to moves which affect their mental state such as Supersonic or Attract. A Slowking and its Shellder share a symbiotic relationship: the Shellder acts as a second pair of eyes for the Slowbro, facing backwards. A Slowking has a higher attack than a Slowbro, but a lower defence.</p>
<p>Slowpoke (Water/Psychic): Slowpoke have a slow reaction time and will experience a short delay when affected by pain or interrupting moves. They will generally take longer than usual to implement its orders and moves around quite slowly. However, this does not make them unintelligent. They have a high resistance to moves which affect their mental state such as Supersonic or Attract.</p>
<p>Slugma (Fire): Slugma can survive in molten lava indefinitely. They can use Acid Armour in lava they way water Pok&#233;mon can use Acid Armor in water (i.e. turn invisible). Any Pok&#233;mon that comes into contact with a Slugma or Magcargo has a 20% chance of being burned and their bodies can provide illumination. They can see in the dark and are inorganic.</p>
<p>Slurpuff (Fairy): Slurpuff have an extremely sensitive sense of smell, allowing it to be aware of its opponent's position as long as they're dry. Slurpuff's bodies are sticky and sweet, making them rather hard to let go of if grappled. Using a move, they can spit a fine thread of sticky, sugary string similar to String Shot to entangle a target. Like a Spinarak, they can use this to pull themselves from place to place more quickly without it counting as a move.</p>
<p>Smeargle (Normal): Smeargle may use the move Sketch to permanently learn new moves. The number of slots Smeargle has is dependent on the owner's trainer level. Smeargle will start with ten moves that it can Sketch. For each level over 1 that a Smeargle's trainer has, it can learn an additional four moves, up to a maximum of 30 total Sketched moves (other moves which Smeargle can learn naturally do not count towards this limit). Moves which Smeargle has learned must be noted in the Miscellaneous Squad Submissions thread and recorded in the Pokémon’s biography. Moves can also be deleted freely using Miscellaneous Squad Submissions. Smeargle may not Sketch the same move more than once without deleting it first and cannot Sketch signature moves or moves learned via signatures. The amount of off-type energy that Smeargle receives is proportional to the types of moves that it copies. Since Smeargle is generally not a natural user of these moves, it cannot use them with familiarity and they may be slightly less effective than normal (though they will deal equivalent damage and use the normal amount of energy, generally). Smeargle may also may use their tails to paint their surroundings or their foes. This counts as a move and can serve a variety of purposes, from marking gathering points to writing taunts that will enrage the opponent. Smeargle have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound based status attacks. They fight more enthusiastically in urban environments.</p>
<p>Smoochum (Ice/Psychic): A Smoochum's kiss attacks are more effective. In the dark, they feel using its lips, and any Pok&#233;mon they feel with their lips has a 10% chance of paralysis or confusion. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective. Smoochum come in both genders. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Sneasel (Dark/Ice): A Sneasel can retract or extend its claws at will. When moving and trying to be stealthy, a Sneasel will retract its claws. When attacking or moving on slippery surfaces, they will be extended. Attacks made using its claws deal 1.1x more damage than usual. Sneasel are adept at hiding itself and can move completely silently. They are also very agile and adept climbers. </p>
<p>Snivy (Grass): Snivy, as a young snake, are fairly swift and agile Pok&#233;mon and the most agile of their line. Their body and coloring allow them to easily hide amongst trees and grass and their Leaf Tornado attack is faster and more disorientating to its targets. They have two vines that stem from their neck. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Snorlax (Normal): Snorlax have huge guts. Any attacks to their guts do less damage because of all the extra padding they have there. Despite their size, they are good swimmers, as they float on the surface of the water. Snorlax are quite slow. Due to having a wide variety of energy available, it is less proficient at maximising the use, resulting in suffering from slightly less type energy.</p>
<p>Snorunt (Ice): Snorunt have powerful jaws that allow them to eat ice and snow. If there is ice or snow in the arena, Snorunt may eat the ice or snow using a move, restoring good health and energy once a battle. If the snow is tainted or poisoned, it will harm them instead. Their biting attacks are 10% more effective than normal. They are adept at hiding in blizzards and can see through them easily. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Snover (Grass/Ice): Snover are able to disguise themselves well in blizzards and snowy areas. Their Hail attack is far more effective than normal, starting faster and dealing mild damage to any non Ice-types on the field for each round it is in effect. Like a Tyranitar uses sand, Snover can generate a hailstorm from its own body and can thus use the technique indoors. Their Blizzard attack takes slightly less energy than normal.</p>
<p>Snubbull (Fairy): Snubbull are proud Pok&#233;mon and more susceptible to moves that induce anger. However, they are also resistant to fear-inducing effects. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves, and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. Snubbull's biting attacks are 1.1x more powerful.</p>
<p>Solgaleo (Psychic/Steel): Solgaleo perpetually emanates an intensely bright light, filling even the darkest of arenas. This will allow moves which require sunlight to be used with impunity. Being a creature able to manipulate dimensional space, their Teleport attack is near instantaneous and can cover a much wider distance than normal. Their roar is much louder than other Pokemon, being more likely to intimidate opponents. Due to their intense connection to the sun, they are considered familiar with the Fire type.</p>
<p>Solosis (Psychic): Solosis's body is surrounded by a liquid chemically similar in composition to a cell's cytoplasm, acting as a protective buffer from the outside environment. The damaging effects of weather, such as Hail or Sandstorm, will be buffered by this coating of liquid, and statuses, like poison or burn, may be weakened or distributed. Toxic will take an extra turn to set in as it diffuses through this liquid coat. They levitate by default.</p>
<p>Solrock (Rock/Psychic): Solrock levitate by default and are considered to be inorganic. They are capable of generating vast amounts of heat by spinning, enough to vaporise moderate and weaker water attacks or dissipate fog, energy use equal to Fire Spin and the technique usable twice per battle. They are also familiar with the Fire type. They fight more enthusiastically in the day time and radiate a constant faint glow that is likened to sunlight. Pok&#233;mon in close proximity to them can use moves which require sunlight, regardless of location, as can Solrock themselves. </p>
<p>Spearow (Normal/Flying): Spearow have short wings which makes them more agile when flying, matching members of the Pidgey line in skill. However, they cannot fly as far, as high, or as fast as most Pok&#233;mon. Attacks made using their beaks are 1.1x as powerful.</p>
<p>Spewpa (Bug): Spewpa's furry body is actually a thick protective layer, guarding it against attack. Using a move, they can bristle the fur, acting much like a short-term Harden. If Spewpa are attacked directly, there is a chance that the foe will inhale paralytic powder, enduing mild paralysis.</p>
<p>Spheal (Water/Ice): Spheal have rotund bodies which allow them to gain speed and momentum very quickly with Rollout. They move primarily by rolling when on land but prefer to swim if possible. If the floor is slippery like an Ice field, they can maneuverable easily using their flippers and tail. They are highly resistant to freezing temperatures and remain nimble in the coldest waters where other Pok&#233;mon might be numbed. They are very agile swimmers, generally. They can easily conceal themselves in snowy and icy environments. They are able to hold objects on their nose, allowing them to manipulate objects and use them in attacks. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Spinarak (Bug/Poison): Spinarak may shoot strands of webbing out of both their fronts and rears. While not powerful enough to damage Pok&#233;mon and too weak to entangle most, they can use it to pull themselves from place to place more quickly without it counting as a move. Spinarak can climb walls and other objects with ease. Their web attacks will be more effective than usual and cost less energy.

If it is struck directly with an attack, it will cause a small explosion, dealing minor recoil to the foe and blowing them back with decent force. It also provides protection against physical attacks, lowering them by 20%. However, physical attacks that hit its vulnerable underside will deal 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Turtwig (Grass): Turtwig are vulnerable if knocked on their backs as they have a hard time getting up. However, in exchange, attacks on their shell do slightly less damage. Despite being turtles, Turtwig are actually quite fast and have a strong jaw that can be difficult to prise off. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Tympole (Water): The ear like structures on Tympole's sides act as amplifiers, giving Tympole a boost to moves that involve sound or vibrations, including moves like Earthquake.</p>
<p>Tynamo (Electric): Tynamo levitate by default. Moving by electro magnetic propulsion, they are not as fast as other levitating Pok&#233;mon, but are much more agile. They are also fairly good swimmers and are able to stay underwater as long as any Water-type.</p>
<p>Type: Null (Normal): Type: Null is a strange, chimeric Pok&#233;mon seemingly created using the traits of multiple Pok&#233;mon. It wears a mysterious helmet around its head, which grants it a slight boost to defense and special defense. However, it is not particularly speedy or agile as a consequence.</p>
<p>Typhlosion (Fire): Typhlosion are the fastest of their evolutionary family, but the least agile. They can control whether their dorsal flames are ignited at any one time. When not ignited, they take only x1.5 damage from Water attack. However, they cannot use any fire attacks if their fire is not ignited. Igniting gives them their normal weakness to water and allows them to provide illumination and burn foes if there is prolonged contact. It also allows them to use fire attacks. Igniting does not count as a move, and happens automatically when the Pok&#233;mon is ordered a fire attack. However, de-igniting counts as a move. They will automatically de-ignite if they fall asleep. They have a x1.2 boost to lava based moves. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Fire-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Tyranitar (Rock/Dark): Having gone through various stages, Tyranitar are now very powerful. Their Earthquake attacks are the most powerful among Pok&#233;mon and deal 1.2x more damage, with Tyranitar being familiar with the Ground type. They also carry over its tough hide, which reduces all damage it receives from physical attacks to 0.8x. A trainer may order Tyranitar to eat the soil as a move. Tyranitar will eat a mouthful, increasing its health and energy a little. Poisonous soil will have the opposite effect, damaging Tyranitar instead of healing it. Their bodies are full of sand, and they are able to use the sand to produce Sandstorms, instead of relying on the sand in the arena. This Sandstorm attack is more persistent than those used by other Pok&#233;mon and will last longer and deal more damage. In its Mega Forme, it is fairly resistant to physical strikes - only powerful physical attacks will deal noticeable damage to them. Much like before its evolution, Tyranitar can produce sandstorms in nearly an instant. Sandstorms produced this way are thicker, more violent and require little concentration to maintain. Against any Pok&#233;mon that would reasonably be afraid of it, it's fear-inducing attacks are more effective.</p>
<p>Tyrantrum (Rock/Dragon): Tyrantrum have powerful jaws, giving a 20% boost to all biting attacks. They are also rather temperamental, making them more vulnerable to rage-inducing moves, but they will have a greater attack boost as a result. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Tyrogue (Fighting): Tyrogue are apprentice fighters and are more skilled than other baby Pok&#233;mon, on par with basic stage members of other lines. All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Tyrunt (Rock/Dragon): Tyrunt have powerful jaws, giving a 10% boost to all biting attacks. They are also rather temperamental, making them more vulnerable to rage-inducing moves, but they will have a greater attack boost as a result. Being fossils, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Umbreon (Dark): Umbreon has sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Umbreon may sweat poison out of their pores as a move. Any Pok&#233;mon not resistant to Poison who comes into physical contact with Umbreon risks being poisoned. The poison stays on Umbreon unless it is somehow washed off. Umbreon are immune to their own poison produced by this method. By concentrating and holding still, Umbreon can cause their rings to glow, brightening the area at the cost of very little energy. Umbreon take slightly less damage from special attacks compared to other Eeveelutions and are resistant to techniques which affect their mental state such as Confuse Ray.</p>
<p>Unfezant (Normal/Flying): Unfezant are peaceful and loyal Pok&#233;mon. They are very faithful to their owners and will rarely willingly deviate from orders, making them less vulnerable to moves like Taunt and Swagger. Their physical defence is slightly higher than other bird Pok&#233;mon and cannot be lowered. Female Unfezant are highly skilled fliers, rivalling Pidgeot in speed and agility. Male Unfezant lack this enhanced skill, but are more resistant to fear and intimidation than other Pok&#233;mon and are considered very attractive, enhancing the effectiveness of moves like Attract.</p>
<p>Unown (Psychic): Unown's Hidden Power costs less energy and deals slightly more damage than normal. They levitate by default, are inorganic and can see in the dark. Their intense, singular focus allows them all the benefits of a permanent Miracle Eye. Unown come in varying shapes, each shape roughly corresponding to a character from an ancient and superior alphabet. They share a hive mind with all Unown in the area automatically, regardless of allegiance, and can come together to form messages.</p>
<p>Ursaring (Normal): Ursaring's forelegs are extremely powerful, doing additional 1.2x damage with any attack used with them. They are also skilled climbers, though their girth makes them more interested in alternative methods of reaching something if they exist. Ursaring are large and intimidating so their fear attacks are more effective. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Uxie (Psychic): Uxie naturally levitates nimbly and quickly, able to maneuver in the air with ease. As the spirit of knowledge, Uxie will have a permanent boost of Cosmic Power, raising defense and special defense. However like other boosting moves, attempts to further boost its defenses will be reduced. Uxie's eyes never open, and as such uses its psychic powers in order to see the world around it. This allows Uxie to see through any illusions as well as not be affected by moves like Flash or Confuse Ray. Uxie is able to use Amnesia as an offensive technique, using it on a target to cause it to temporarily become stunned as its mind is forcibly cleared. Uxie's red gems boost its Psychic abilities, granting it much greater proficiency with non-damaging Psychic moves as well as a slightly higher offensive power with Psychic attacks.</p>
<p>Vanillish (Ice): Vanillish move primarily through levitation, able to use bursts of mist to propel themselves. As such, they are relatively agile though not particularly fast. The Vanillite line, being made primarily of Ice, can easily manipulate ice and water, able to produce mists and fogs with great ease and summon up water or ice based attacks faster than others. Their Hail attack is far more effective than normal, starting faster and dealing mild damage to any non Ice-types on the field for each round it is used. Their icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pokémon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind.</p>
<p>Vanillite (Ice): Vanillite move by 'skating' over the ground and levitation, propelling themselves with bursts of mist, able to move fairly quickly and with decent agility. The Vanillite line, being made primarily of Ice, can easily manipulate ice and water, able to produce mists and fogs with great ease and summon up water or ice based attacks faster than others. Their Hail attack is far more effective than normal, starting faster and dealing mild damage to any non Ice-types on the field for each round it is used. Their icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pokémon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind.</p>
<p>Vanilluxe (Ice): Vanilluxe levitates by default, and can move more quickly through the air with bursts of mist. The Vanillite line, being made primarily of Ice, can easily manipulate ice and water, able to produce mists and fogs with great ease and summon up water or ice based attacks faster than others. Their Hail attack is far more effective than normal, starting faster and dealing mild damage to any non Ice-types on the field for each round it is used. Their icy bodies are extremely cold. Any Pok&#233;mon coming in contact with them will be chilled similarly to Icy Wind. Their Blizzard attack is more powerful than usual, and won't tire them as much to use.</p>
<p>Vaporeon (Water): Members of the Eevee line have sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. Their Baton Pass and Helping Hand attacks take slightly less time and energy to perform compared to other Pok&#233;mon. Vaporeon are also good swimmers and just as agile on land as they are in the water. Vaporeon are more adept at using their Acid Armour technique to hide in water than other Pok&#233;mon.</p>
<p>Venipede (Bug/Poison): Venipede have developed a specialized poison as a method of self-defense against Flying Pok&#233;mon, with a slight (5%) additional chance of mild to moderate paralysis around the contact site if foes make contact.</p>
<p>Venomoth (Bug/Poison): Venomoth are capable of flying and, despite their lack of the Flying-type, are quite agile. Their spore based attacks are slightly more effective than normal. Venomoth have a sort of radar vision, which allows them to see almost completely around themselves. This will also allow them an uncanny ability to determine the location of their opponent, regardless of how well hidden they are. This keen eyesight also improves their accuracy with attacks slightly.</p>
<p>Venonat (Bug/Poison): Venonat have a sort of radar vision, which allows them to see almost completely around themselves. This will also allow them an uncanny ability to determine the location of their opponent, regardless of how well hidden they are. This keen eyesight also improves their accuracy with attacks slightly.</p>
<p>Venusaur (Grass/Poison): Venusaur are the fastest of their line but are not particularly agile. They have eight vines, which means they can hit and grab multiple things at once and that attacks made using their vines are slightly more powerful. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Grass-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health. In its Mega Forme it gains a thick layer of cellulose in their skin similar to Hariyama's fat. Due to this it takes 30% less damage from Ice and Fire type attacks.</p>
<p>Vespiquen (Bug/Flying): Vespiquen are capable of controlling Combee in the area. They can use their "Order" attacks with nearby Combee, requiring much less energy to do so. They have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team and have slightly higher Defense and Special Defense compared to most Bug-types. Vespiquen are intimidating Pok&#233;mon, particularly in numbers. Multiple Beedrill, Combee and Vespiquen on the same side share a hive mind, meaning that one cannot be surprised unless they all are and one cannot be affected mentally unless they all are. Their attacks also become more coordinated, making it harder for the foe to dodge combination attacks.</p>
<p>Vibrava (Ground/Dragon): With evolution and bulk, Vibrava become a less effective diggers than their pre-evolution, though they can still conceal themselves well within sandy environments and fight more enthusiastically there. They can see in the dark. They are agile fliers, though not particularly fast, and are familiar with the Bug type. Because they flap their wings so quickly and produce a near ultrasonic but distracting noise, attacks which use their wings to strike have a 10% flinch chance against their targets.</p>
<p>Victini (Psychic/Fire): Victini is the embodiment of the spirit of victory. As success flows through it, it will rarely encounter failure. Moves that would otherwise fail will succeed for Victini, and cases where Victini has a chance of failure will work in Victini's favor. Additionally, Victini's moves are more accurate than normal.</p>
<p>Victreebel (Grass/Poison): Victreebel generally moves by hopping and is not particularly fast or agile. It can exhale air out of its pitcher to keep hovering a few feet from the ground, but it is not very mobile. Their Ingrain technique is much more effective than normal and their Acid based attacks deal 1.2x the normal damage. They have two vines hidden beneath their leaves that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack and they can use the vine on their head for the same effect. Victreebel, despite their size, are mostly hollow, with most of their body dedicated to their pitcher. They can attempt to grab and swallow anything smaller than them in their pitcher. This counts as a two-move combo and they can attempt no other moves that round. However, they are considered to use Giga Drain on anything inside of them automatically each round, draining health and energy from the opponent and giving it to Victreebel (this does not count as a move). Due to the digestive fluids contained within, victims are essentially bathed in Acid and will suffer the effects of that move as well as passive damage over time. This lasts until the Pok&#233;mon escapes or Victreebel or the Pok&#233;mon inside are KO'ed, in which case they will eject the Pok&#233;mon. Pok&#233;mon inside Victreebel may still be ordered, though their first priority will be to escape. Their pitchers have slippery walls and are half-filled with digestive fluids.</p>
<p>Vigoroth (Normal): Vigoroth always want to be active and find it impossible to remain still. A Vigoroth has more energy than normal, but uses it at a quicker rate. Because of their active nature, Vigoroth are more resistant to effects that cause Sleep and will wake more quickly from the condition. They are also excellent climbers.</p>
<p>Vikavolt (Bug/Electric): Vikavolt is a fast flier, though not particularly agile. Though it can make quick aerial maneuvers such as flips and banks, it takes wide turns and cannot easily reverse. Vikavolt has a powerful jaw, which it can use for digging. Its biting attacks are 20% stronger than normal. It holds a constant Charge, making its Electrical attacks slightly faster and more powerful than average. It can also use a move to sap good Electrical energy from its ally to slightly improve the power of its next Electric move and restore good energy.</p>
<p>Vileplume (Grass/Poison): Vileplume's heads are heavy, making movement harder for them. They smell absolutely horrible. Any Pok&#233;mon within five feet of them have a 20% chance of flinching and Pok&#233;mon within three feet will experience blurred vision and a slight reduction in attack and special attack. Inorganic Pok&#233;mon and members of the Oddish line are unaffected but Pok&#233;mon with sensitive smell will be more heavily affected. As a nocturnal Pok&#233;mon that thrives by the light of the moon, it can benefit from exposure to moonlight much like other Grass-types can from bright sun. Additionally, its Moonlight will not use Fairy energy if exposed to moonlight. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Virizion (Grass/Fighting): The most elegant and graceful member of the Swords of Justice, Virizion is an agile and swift fighter. Virizion's movements allow it to be somewhat more evasive then normal when attacking, and its delicate but sure-footedness afford it a strong resistance to both the damage and buffetting effects of wind-based attacks. This also makes Virizion extremely difficult to knock over or move around against its will. Its horns can extend much like Gallade's arms to be used in slashing or cutting attacks. Said attacks get a 20% boost to their power, including Sacred Sword.</p>
<p>Vivillon (Bug/Flying): Vivillon's wings come in a number of patterns, depending on the environment in which the bug developed. Some patterns are bright and ostentatious while others are muted and more suited for camouflage. If their wings are an appropriate pattern for the environment of the battle, they can hide themselves, making them much more difficult to spot. Their wings are constantly covered in fine spores which are used in their powder attacks, making them significantly more potent. In addition, when they fall below 1/3 health, they become empowered, their STAB attacks dealing 10% extra damage.</p>
<p>Volbeat (Bug): Volbeat and Illumise are considered male and female variations of the same Pok&#233;mon, and therefore the Attracts of both species are considered to work as if both Volbeat and Illumise were the same species of Pok&#233;mon. Volbeat have a light on their tail that they can use to illuminate areas, though they make them more visible in the dark. Volbeat are familiar with the Electric type.</p>
<p>Volcanion (Fire/Water): Volcanion is constantly boiling water within its own body. This makes it incredibly hot to the touch and can cause mild burns upon contact. Due to the steam buildup within it, Volcanion's Water attacks jettison out with more power than usual and deal 1.1x as much damage and have a 10% chance to burn. Volcanion's Haze and Mist techniques are more effective than usual, and the legend is constantly surrounded by steam in a ten foot radius around his body, obscuring him from view.</p>
<p>Volcorona (Bug/Fire): Volcorona have gigantic wings which them it to fly with great grace and ease. These wings constantly issue embers, and being within three or so feet can cause mild damage each round to foes due to the embers. They are capable of generating vast amounts of heat by flapping their wings, enough to melt moderate and weaker Rock attacks or dissipate fog. Energy use is equal to Fire Spin and is usable twice per battle.</p>
<p>Voltorb (Electric): Voltorb are able to levitate above the ground, although their flight ceiling is lower than other Pokemon. Alternatively, they may choose to disengage their levitation, moving instead by rolling, withtheir movement speed being dependent on the smoothness of the terrain. They are fastest on flat, smooth ground and slowest on rocky ground. On flat ground, they are faster than many Pokémon. Engaging and disengaging levitation does not require a move. However, they make up for this with an impressive speed, being able to move quickly and agilely. Voltorb's Selfdestruct and Explosion attacks charge much faster than other Pokémon. They are inorganic and fight more enthusiastically in man made environments.</p>
<p>Vullaby (Dark/Flying): The bones around their waist act as a defensive buffer, giving them a slight boost in defense for all attacks that hit around that area. Vullaby's small wings make it a slower flier than most. Being vultures, they are resistant to poisoning.</p>
<p>Vulpix (Fire): As foxes, Vulpix are more inclined to combat by deception, their deception based attacks being slightly more potent. Their Confuse Ray is more effective and their Double Team produces one additional copy. They have sensitive hearing, at the expense of greater vulnerability to sound based status attacks. Owing to their physical beauty, attacks like Attract are more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Vulpix [Alola] (Ice): Alolan Vulpix are not too dissimilar from their wild-type counterparts - they are equally adept at manipulating ice and cold as wild-type Vulpix are at manipulating fire and heat. As foxes, Vulpix are more inclined to combat by deception, their deception based attacks being slightly more potent. Their Confuse Ray is more effective and their Double Team produces one additional copy. They have sensitive hearing, at the expense of greater vulnerability to sound based status attacks. Owing to their physical beauty, attacks like Attract are more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Wailmer (Water): Wailmer are large, slow, and somewhat gangly. They are neither great on land nor a fantastic swimmers in water. Their fat, round body, however, allows them to survive intense pressures, swim comfortably in freezing water, and take slightly less damage from physical attacks. They can also control their depth very well and are hard to force under or up. They can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a very sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Wailord (Water): Wailord are huge, and even more awkward on land than its pre-evolution. However, they are better swimmers and even better divers, having full control over their depth and able to swiftly dive up or down. Their blubbery, massive body give them a resistance against physical attacks. They are far more comfortable in large, open arenas where they can move freely, and if too restricted, they may be completely unable to fight. They can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in an extremely sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Walrein (Water/Ice): Walrein have rotund bodies which allow them to gain speed and momentum very quickly with Rollout. They move primarily by rolling or sliding when on land but prefer to swim if possible. If the floor is slippery like an Ice field, they can maneuverable easily using their flippers and tail. They are highly resistant to freezing temperatures and remain nimble in the coldest waters where other Pok&#233;mon might be numbed. They are very agile swimmers, generally. They can easily conceal themselves in snowy and icy environments. They are able to hold objects on their nose, allowing them to manipulate objects and use them in attacks. Their large tusks add additional crushing damage to biting attacks, making them 1.2x more potent. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Wartortle (Water): The most militant of their family, Wartortle are the middle of the line in speed and agility. They are vulnerable if knocked on their backs and have a hard time getting up though attacks that strike their back suffer from a slight drop in power. As starter Pok&#233;mon, their Water-type attacks are slightly more powerful when they drop below 1/3 health.</p>
<p>Watchog (Normal): As lookouts, Watchog have extremely keen eyesight, allowing them to see long distances and in fogs, smoke or otherwise obstructing conditions. Their accuracy cannot be lowered. They are difficult to fool and can more easily see through illusions. They also can illuminate the rings on their body, allowing them to light up the arena for very little energy. Natural pranksters, they use non damaging moves that target the foe faster than usual. Techniques that involve holding eye contact will be slightly more effective when used by Watchog. They are adept climbers.</p>
<p>Weavile (Dark/Ice): A Weavile can retract or extend its claws at will. When moving and trying to be stealthy, a Weavile will retract its claws. Attacks made using its claws deal 1.2x more damage than usual. When attacking or moving on slippery surfaces, they will be extended. Weavile are adept at hiding itself and can move completely silently. They are also very agile and adept climbers. </p>
<p>Weedle (Bug/Poison): Weedle, while not powerful Pok&#233;mon, have extremely sticky feet. If a throwing move dependent on the opponent's weight is used, they are considered to weigh 100 pounds for the duration of the attack if they are holding on to a surface.</p>
<p>Weepinbell (Grass/Poison): Weepinbell generally moves by hopping and is not particularly fast or agile. They can exhale air out of its pitcher to keep hovering a few feet from the ground, but they are not very mobile. Their Ingrain technique is much more effective than normal and their Acid based attacks deal 1.1x the normal damage. They have two vines hidden beneath their leaves that they can extend to use to manipulate objects and Pok&#233;mon and attack and they can use the vine on their head for the same effect. Weepinbell, despite their size, are mostly hollow, with most of their body dedicated to their pitcher. They can attempt to grab and swallow anything smaller than them in their pitcher. This counts as a two-move combo and they can attempt no other moves that round. However, they are considered to use Giga Drain on anything inside of them automatically each round, draining health and energy from the opponent and giving it to Weepinbell (this does not count as a move). Due to the digestive fluids contained within, victims are essentially bathed in Acid and will suffer the effects of that move as well as passive damage over time. This lasts until the Pok&#233;mon escapes or Weepinbell or the Pok&#233;mon inside are KO'ed, in which case they will eject the Pok&#233;mon. Pok&#233;mon inside Weepinbell may still be ordered, though their first priority will be to escape. Their pitchers have slippery walls and are half-filled with digestive fluids.</p>
<p>Weezing (Poison): Weezing levitate by default. They are made of poison. Thus, they thrive in environments where such poisons are abound. They are healed by toxic chemicals instead of harmed, and poison attacks heal them instead of harm them. Weezing use their internal gases to move and float about: however, they cannot go under water, instead it will float at the top. Weezing have a 5% chance of Exploding when KO'ed. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Whimsicott (Grass/Fairy): Whimsicott use their cottony head to ride whirlwinds and currents. Although, like Jumpluff, they cannot explicitly fly, they can generate winds or ride currents allowing them to float with some level of control. When attacked, they release a light puff of cotton, which may cause light symptoms similar to the effects of Cotton Spore. Natural pranksters, they use non damaging moves that target the foe faster than usual. Their Cotton Spore and Cotton Guard attacks are significantly more effective than normal.</p>
<p>Whirlipede (Bug/Poison): Whirlipede move much like a wheel, rotating the spiked shell around their body to move. They can also rev up to gain an immediate burst of speed. Thanks to the adaptation of their preevo, their poison also has a 5% chance of localized paralysis if foes make contact.</p>
<p>Whiscash (Water/Ground): Whiscash are naturally wet, their slime making them difficult to hold onto and grab and preventing them from being affected by Electric attacks. Their movements are awkward out of water. Their whiskers can also help locate a real opponent if it is nearby when using techniques such as Double Team or in places with limited visibility and they can see in the dark. These Pok&#233;mon can set off earthquakes with ease and any earth-based ground attacks are quicker to use and will require less energy. They fight more enthusiastically when submerged and in a sizeable body of water.</p>
<p>Whismur (Normal): Whismur have sensitive hearing but are unaffected by sound-based status techniques like Supersonic. They still take damage from such moves where applicable. Their sound moves are slightly more potent, and can be used at standard potency even when spread. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Wigglytuff (Normal/Fairy): Wigglytuff can inflate themselves as a move to intimidate opponents, making them more hesitant to attack. While inflated, they have a harder time moving, but a moderately higher defense. Despite their lack of agility in this inflated state, they can float in to the air at a steady pace. Their Sing attack is more effective, requiring less be sung to put an opponent to sleep. Wigglytuff have more sensitive hearing, at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status techniques like Supersonic.</p>
<p>Wimpod (Bug/Water): Wimpod are very skittish Pok&#233;mon, and will often run at the first sign of danger. When they drop under half health, they will become more evasive and a little more agile, but are much easier to frighten. It's tendency to eat even rotten food has left it with a slight resistance to being poisoned.</p>
<p>Wingull (Water/Flying): Though Wingull are adequate fliers, their bodies are built for gliding. They can easily take advantage of wind currents to increase their speed. Therefore, Tailwind is more beneficial to them and they can easily fight an opposing Tailwind. Wingull can dive underwater for a short time, though not very fast nor very deep.</p>
<p>Wishiwashi (Water): Upon being sent into battle, Wishiwashi will immediately change into it's School form, although this transformation can only occur if Wishiwashi is at least level 2. In this form, all of it's Water type attacks become significantly more powerful, dealing an extra 20% more damage. In addition, Wishiwashi will constantly exude an overpowering aura of fear when in this form, easily intimidating smaller Pokemon. When Wishiwashi reaches it's final third, it will revert to it's Minnow form. In this form, Wishiwashi becomes much faster, and due to it's smaller size, becomes incredibly adept at hiding from the opponent</p>
<p>Wobbuffet (Psychic): Wobbuffet are slow and clumsy at moving around, travelling via shuffle. They are better at using attacks like Mirror Coat and Counter than other Pok&#233;mon, and their energy usage will be significantly less than others. Their Counter and Mirror Coat attacks will never fail. They are also resistant to pain and difficult to interrupt, while also being immune to Taunt and Torment due to their laid back nature. Their Encore attack is more likely to succeed than other Pok&#233;mon. Due to their hardy natures, they will receive a 10% reduction on all incoming damage, but this will not affect their output with Counter or Mirror Coat. They can see in the dark.</p>
<p>Woobat (Psychic/Flying): Despite having eyes below their fur, Woobat primarily use supersonic waves to perceive their surroundings, much like Zubat. They can cling to surfaces using their heart-shaped nostrils, making them harder to remove. They can see in the dark and have sensitive hearing, at the expense of increased vulnerability to sound based status attacks, though they are immune to confusion from Supersonic. They are very agile fliers. They fight more enthusiastically at night.</p>
<p>Wooper (Water/Ground): Wooper are good swimmers, but they are just as comfortable on land. They are coated with a slimy substance, which makes them harder to grab and prevents them from being affected by Electric attacks when wet.</p>
<p>Wormadam (Bug/Varies): Wormadam's second type (and associated moveset) are dependent on their cloak. Plant cloak will make them Bug/Grass, Sandy Cloak will make them Bug/Ground, and Trash Cloak will a make them Bug/Steel. Upon acquiring a Wormadam, trainers must specify which cloak it wears; this cannot be changed. Wormadam can blend into the environment with ease, and are capable of staying perfectly still to avoid detection. They battle more enthusiastically when in areas appropriate to their cloaks. If in an arena appropriate to its cloak, then once per battle Wormadam may collect scraps from the environment to replenish significant health and give it a slight boost to both defences. This counts as its one healing move. They levitate by default, but can hold onto things with their appendage on their head. This appendage is extendable and can be used like a Spinarak's web to move around more quickly.</p>
<p>Wurmple (Bug): Wurmple, while not powerful Pok&#233;mon, have extremely sticky feet. If a throwing move dependent on the opponent's weight is used, Wurmple is considered to weigh 100 pounds for the duration of the attack, if it is on the ground when the attack begins.</p>
<p>Wynaut (Psychic): Wynaut are far more energetic than their evolution. They move via shuffling and are quite slow, though are faster than their evolved form. They are better at using attacks like Mirror Coat and Counter than other Pok&#233;mon, and their energy usage will be slightly less than others. Their Counter and Mirror Coat attacks will never fail. They are also resistant to pain and difficult to interrupt, while also being immune to Taunt and Torment due to their laid back nature. Their Encore attack is more likely to succeed than other Pok&#233;mon. Due to their hardy natures, they will receive a 10% reduction on all incoming damage, but this will not affect their output with Counter or Mirror Coat. They can see in the dark All baby Pok&#233;mon's techniques that are based on cuteness (such as Charm, Attract, Sweet Kiss, etc) are slightly more effective.</p>
<p>Xatu (Psychic/Flying): Xatu are not the best of fliers but are more capable than Natu. They can also levitate, though they are not particularly fast or agile. Xatu can hold very still, making them harder to spot if they are hiding. They have limited precognition, allowing them to dodge attacks more easily like an Espeon. Their Future Sight attack takes slightly less energy than usual to use. Techniques that involve holding eye contact will be slightly more effective when used by Xatu.</p>
<p>Xerneas (Fairy): Xerneas is the embodiment of life. It has a deep connection with the environment and will always benefit positively from any environment it is in. Its Misty Terrain is twice as effective and lasts twice as long. It is capable of using moves summoned by Nature Power unlimitedly. Xerneas has two "modes", the Neutral Mode, generally for when it is not in battle, and the Active Mode, which it takes on when fighting. Using a move, Xerneas may go into Neutral Mode, causing the color to fade from its horns. This is roughly equivalent to using Rest, though Xerneas will be conscious and may still act defensively while in Neutral Mode. All its Fairy-attacks are 20% more powerful.</p>
<p>Xurkitree (Electric): Xurkitree's entire body is designed to regulate electricity, and as such it will permanently be under the effects of Charge. Its cable like arms can be extended a reasonable distance in order to strike foes, and they allow it to direct it's electric attacks perfectly, as if Rain Dance were in effect. Whenever Xurkitree defeats an opponent, they gain a slight boost to their Special Attack.</p>
<p>Yamask (Ghost): Yamask carry around a mask resembling a human face. The mask is solid, but the rest of Yamask's body is ethereal. Though the mask appears to be a part of them, Yamask are actually only carrying it and it can use it to block small attacks using a move. They can also use the mask defensively against special moves, taking standard damage when they hit the mask rather than their bodies. Yamask may drop their mask in battle, but do not like to travel far from it and will always check to make sure that it is there after using a move. Yamask cannot change their state because of their bond with their mask. They levitate by default. Despite being locked out of the physical state, they take only 10% extra damage from special moves. They cannot be poisoned.</p>
<p>Yanma (Bug/Flying): Yanma make a humming noise as they flaps their wings. This makes them easier to locate, but the noise is very irritating close up. Any Pok&#233;mon within three feet of Yanma have a 10% chance of flinching from the sound (20% if the Pok&#233;mon has sensitive hearing).They are very fast and agile fliers, able to maneuver in the air in nearly any direction when moving slowly, as well as being capable of reaching high speeds.</p>
<p>Yanmega (Bug/Flying): Yanmega make a humming noise as they flaps their wings. This makes them easier to locate, however, the noise is very irritating close up, and any Pok&#233;mon within five feet of Yanma have a 10% chance of flinching from the sound (20% if the Pok&#233;mon has sensitive hearing). They are very fast and agile fliers, able to maneuver in the air in nearly any direction when moving slowly, as well as being capable of reaching high speeds. Being prehistoric, their Ancient Power attack will boost slightly more often.</p>
<p>Yungoos (Normal): Yungoos have extremely strong jaws. This gives the Pok&#233;mon a 10% boost to biting attacks. They are also extremely patient Pok&#233;mon and will generally be able to outlast foes in standoffs and stalemates,. This nature also allows them to more easily see through trickery and deception. Their Revenge and Payback attacks use slightly less energy than normal.</p>
<p>Yveltal (Dark/Flying): Yveltal is the embodiment of death. Yveltal is a strong flier, though not terribly fast. Once a battle, Yveltal may absorb the life energy from the arena, causing all plant life in the arena to die. This will restore significant health and energy. All its Dark-type attacks are 20% more powerful.</p>
<p>Zangoose (Normal): Zangoose have a traditional feud with Seviper and go into a rage whenever on a battlefield at the same time as a Seviper. Zangoose will then only follow orders to attack Seviper and will ignore any other orders. If not given any orders involving Seviper, they will automatically attack it using random physical attacks. Because of this rivalry, they are highly resistant to being poisoned and take slightly less damage from poison moves. They also deal 1.2x damage with claw based attacks. </p>
<p>Zapdos (Electric/Flying): As the legendary bird of lightning, Zapdos crackles with electricity whenever it beats its wings. While this produces noise that makes it easier to locate, any Pok&#233;mon within 10 feet of Zapdos will receive electrical damage equal to a Spark once per round if they enter or remain within that distance. This does not occur within 3 feet of Zapdos, allowing people to ride it without being shocked. Its Rain Dance attack is much more powerful than normal, starting almost instantly at full power, lasting twice as long as usual and being much harder to change against Zapdos' wishes, and its Thunder attack requires slightly less energy.</p>
<p>Zebstrika (Electric): Zebstrika are brimming with electrical energy, often releasing small amounts through their mane, causing it to flash brightly. Their mane can be illuminated for a longer period of time, allowing it to illuminate an area much like an Ampharos. Though far less agile than Blitzle, Zebstrika can run at high speeds for a short time, making their speed-based attacks somewhat more effective. When using Agility, they leave a trail of sparks, which do light Electric damage to anything that walks over or stands on them. Any attack they execute with their hooves is 1.2x as powerful.</p>
<p>Zekrom (Dragon/Electric): The black half of the mythical Unova Dragon, Zekrom embodies electrical energy and power. Zekrom may activate its turbine, increasing the speed and power of its Electric attacks by 20% while decreasing their charge time. In this state, electric attacks will use slightly more energy. Zekrom can fly through the air fairly fast and relatively nimbly for its size.</p>
<p>Zigzagoon (Normal): Zigzagoon aren't terribly fast, but they are very agile. When they run, they typically zigzag, lending them their name, and as such, can turn very easily and quickly. Their hearing is more sensitive than normal at the expense of being more vulnerable to sound-based status moves and they have an excellent sense of smell which allows them to track opponents and tell the real clone in a Double Team. They are also skilled at digging.</p>
<p>Zoroark (Dark): In addition to a boost to all moves that involve deception, trickery or illusions, Zoroark are also able to generate complex illusions to trick their foe. When ordered, they can project an illusion of any object in his vicinity or any Pok&#233;mon in their trainer's party. They will make a Double Team-like projection that surrounds their body, taking on any visual characteristics the subject of the projection possesses. As long as the illusion is sustained, they will take on any visual characteristics it might possess, such as intimidation or cuteness. This may also be used as camouflage. The illusions act similarly to Double Team clones and will be dispersed by most attacks (including Foresight and Odor Sleuth), and while Zoroark using an attack will not dispel the illusion, it may weaken their effectiveness, especially if it is ordered to perform an attack that the subject of the illusion would be unable to do (such as a Pikachu using Fire Spin). This technique costs good energy and while it can be used any number of times, it loses their effectiveness with subsequent uses.</p>
<p>Zorua (Dark): In addition to a boost to all moves that involve deception, trickery or illusions, Zorua are also able to generate complex illusions to trick their foe. When ordered, they can project an illusion of any object in his vicinity or any Pok&#233;mon in their trainer's party. They will make a Double Team-like projection that surrounds their body, taking on any visual characteristics the subject of the projection possesses. As long as the illusion is sustained, they will take on any visual characteristics it might possess, such as intimidation or cuteness. This may also be used as camouflage. The illusions act similarly to Double Team clones and will be dispersed by most attacks (including Foresight and Odor Sleuth), and while Zorua using an attack will not dispel the illusion, it may weaken their effectiveness, especially if it is ordered to perform an attack that the subject of the illusion would be unable to do (such as a Pikachu using Fire Spin). This technique costs good energy and while it can be used any number of times, it loses their effectiveness with subsequent uses.</p>
<p>Zubat (Poison/Flying): Zubat are completely blind as they have no eyes. However, they use sonar to detect things, which means that they cannot be fooled by visual illusions (such as Double Team). Zubat have sensitive hearing, at the expense of increased vulnerability to sound based status attacks, but are immune to confusion from Supersonic. They fight more enthusiastically at night. </p>
<p>Zweilous (Dark/Dragon): Zweilous are blind, but due to this, is in a constant state of confusion and rage. This makes their attacks less accurate but as if powered permanently by a Howl. It does still have some perception of their world, though, able to hear and smell foes, and possibly sense their movement. Their two heads will rarely work together, but when both do happen to perform the same attack on the same target (about a 10% chance, adjusted based on the circumstances), the power of the attack will rise.</p>
<p>Zygarde (Dragon/Ground): Zygarde is the guardian of the environment of Kalos, the embodiment of order. Zygarde neutralizes the boost Xerneas and Yveltal get to Fairy and Dark attacks, respectively, when present on the field, instead decreasing their power by 20%. Zygarde, despite being rather snake-like, moves with decent speed across the ground. It can use the light-producing scales on its body to illuminate areas.</p>
