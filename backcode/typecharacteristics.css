span.task[tc-bug]:before { content: "Bug-types can see in the dark, and they have largely enhanced sight, granting them a small boost to the accuracy of their moves. Most live in warm climates, though they hate fire and dislike extreme cold. Their status inducing attacks have an extra 10% chance of inflicting statuses and the resulting statuses are slightly more potent than usual. Bug types are in general more nimble than other Pok\00e9mon, though not necessarily faster, and will quickly out manoeuvre opponents when using unconventional movement." ; }
span.task[tc-dark]:before { content: "Dark-types can see in the dark. They fight more enthusiastically at night and are more effective at hiding in dark environments than other Pok\00e9mon, though light does not adversely affect them. Their Dark type attacks will also become much more intimidating during the night, giving them a small additional chance to flinch. They are immune to the damaging effects of Psychic-type energy but may still be lifted and manipulated by telekinesis. They are slightly better at tricking opponents than other Pok\00e9mon, allowing them to plant more potent curses and to use moves like Feint Attack to greater effect." ; }
span.task[tc-dragon]:before { content: "Dragon-types tend to be strong swimmers and fliers, though they are not always as agile as other Pok\00e9mon. They fight more enthusiastically in warm climates but are less enthusiastic in colder ones. They radiate warmth from their core, and are slightly more resistant to chilling effects than other Pok\00e9mon. They are naturally very powerful Pok\00e9mon and their Dragon type attacks will have a stronger knockback than normal, but will deal no extra damage because of this." ; }
span.task[tc-electric]:before { content: "Electric types are resistant to paralysis inflicted by Electric-type moves, though they may be paralysed as normal by other methods. Electric types do not suffer from recoil damage when using Electric attacks in the water. They have a high degree of control over their Electric type attacks, and as such they will suffer less from attempts to redirect them." ; }
span.task[tc-fairy]:before { content: "Fairy-types are generally pure hearted and gregarious. They prefer natural environments and will fight more enthusiastically in them, but they will not be off put by urban environments. Any attack used by a Fairy-type which manipulates the environment is slightly more effective owing to the magical energies involved and attacks which boost allied Pok\00e9mon is slightly more effective at providing a buff. They are immune to the damaging effects of Dragon-typed energy." ; }
span.task[tc-fighting]:before { content: "Fighting-type Pok\00e9mon train extensively, more than any other Pok\00e9mon type, giving them greater endurance and readiness than other Pok\00e9mon and allowing them to push themselves harder for longer. They are more accurate with their physical blows and more adept at blocking and countering physical attacks, able to do this against most physical assaults. Being physically powerful, they can lift much more than normal Pok\00e9mon, though this does not grant them an attack boost. They fight more enthusiastically in urban environments but are not adversely affected by more natural surroundings." ; }
span.task[tc-fire]:before { content: "Fire-types fight most enthusiastically in hot and dry conditions. They are extremely difficult to burn and most can survive in hot liquids/molten lava for an extended period of time. Fire-type Pok\00e9mon are not adversely affected by taking dips in bodies of water, so long as the time is short. Their Fire type moves will be hotter than normal, allowing them to inflict more potent burns with a greater frequency, and their Fire type moves will naturally have a somewhat wider spread without a loss in power." ; }
span.task[tc-flying]:before { content: "Flying-type Pok\00e9mon are faster and more agile in their chosen mode of transportation than other Pok\00e9mon. Because of their skill in controlling their movement, they are more difficult to evade when using physical moves and more likely to succeed in dodging attacks. This also means that they are much harder to knock off course after gathering momentum. They are also more adept at commanding the wind, and they can use these attacks with slightly less energy than normal. Flying type Pok\00e9mon are affected normally by the damaging effects of Ground-typed energy and take neutral damage from Ground type moves in the ASB. They fight more enthusiastically in spacious arenas but are not put off by cramped conditions." ; }
span.task[tc-ghost]:before { content: "Ghost-type Pok\00e9mon fight more enthusiastically at night, though are not put off by fighting in the day, and can see in the dark. Ghosts are resistant to curses and curses imposed on them will last for a shorter time and be less potent. Their fear inducing attacks are more effective than those used by other Pok\00e9mon. Ghost types can be poisoned, unless stated otherwise. Ghost-types are not fully immune to Normal, Fighting or typeless attacks as in the games, taking neutral damage, but some may change their state in order to reduce damage from physical moves (see Ghost Pok\00e9mon information for details)." ; }
span.task[tc-grass]:before { content: "Grass-type Pok\00e9mon live anywhere that can support vegetation and are adept at concealing themselves in such places. They enjoy both bright sun and rain and fight more enthusiastically in the day time, though they are not put off by fighting at night. Rainstorms will heal them slightly every round the rain falls, while very bright sunlight will regenerate their energy instead. Their healing moves cost slightly less energy and their draining moves will heal them by a greater amount while suffering only half of the usual diminishing returns. They are immune to spore based techniques like Sleep Powder and are more adept at using such attacks themselves, creating denser concentrations of spores which are harder to disperse and more potent in their effects. Any attack used by Grass-types manipulating the environment is slightly more potent, and their Grass-type attacks which utilise plant foliage (such as Razor Leaf) are more efficient in natural environments." ; }
span.task[tc-ground]:before { content: "Ground-type Pok\00e9mon are considered to be immune to electricity while standing on the ground. If a Ground Pok\00e9mon is in the air, they take 0.75x the usual damage from Electric-type attacks, and will take neutral damage from Electric when wet. Ground types do not suffer from recoil damage when using Electric attacks in the water. Ground-type Pok\00e9mon are more adept at manipulating outdoor and 'natural' environments than other Pok\00e9mon and will spend less energy using Dig, Earthquake etc. This allows them to use Ground attacks on any surface, with the exception of Dig. They can also cause the ground to shake more vigorously when using Earthquake and Bulldoze." ; }
span.task[tc-ice]:before { content: "Ice-type Pok\00e9mon are highly resistant to cold and fight more enthusuastically in cold environments. However, they hate hot temperatures, and will not fight as enthusiastically. If their STAB attacks have a secondary effect, they are slightly more likely to have their effects triggered. Their Ice type moves are significantly colder than those used by any other Pok\00e9mon, giving them a much greater ability to numb and slow the foe. In addition, any areas frozen by an Ice type will become sore even after the ice has been knocked loose, creating a painful area like Crush Claw does. Their chilled bodies allow them to create ice more readily than other Pok\00e9mon, significantly speeding up their Ice type attacks. Ice-types are generally sure footed and difficult to knock over, moving with ease across slippery surfaces and through strong winds and storms." ; }
span.task[tc-mega]:before { content: "Pok\00e9mon in their Mega Forme are considered one level higher than their base form. In Mega Forme, they therefore have all the benefits and drawbacks of uplevels. If a Pok\00e9mon which is already an uplevel Mega Evolves, it can trigger disobedience on its own. Transforming to Mega works like conventional switching; it does not cost a move, but must be the first thing done in a round and (if done going second) allows the opponent a re-order. Once in this Forme, Pok\00e9mon may not change back until they faint." ; }
span.task[tc-normal]:before { content: "Normal-type Pok\00e9mon are able to use support moves to greater effect than other Pok\00e9mon, with them being performed slightly quicker and being slightly more potent. Being beings of great balance, they benefit more from the positive effects of weather and other arena affecting moves, but will not suffer as badly from the negative effects. In the ASB, Normal-types take resisted damage from the damaging effects of Ghost-type energy." ; }
span.task[tc-poison]:before { content: "Poison-type Pok\00e9mon are immune to poisoning. Their Poison-type attacks are slightly more likely to succeed in poisoning their targets than those used by other Pok\00e9mon and the effects will be slightly more potent. They also have an additional 10% chance to poison the target when using physical attacks with their most venomous appendages e.g. a Seviper's tail, a Nidoking's horn." ; }
span.task[tc-psychci]:before { content: "Psychic-type Pok\00e9mon are much more proficient with telekinesis than other Pok\00e9mon. Thus, they can use Psychic to move and manipulate targets with ease. Psychic type Pok\00e9mon are resistant to flinching, having higher levels of focus and concentration than other Pok\00e9mon. They are resistant to attacks which induce confusion or other mental effects. They have limited ability to read minds and are thus more adept at dodging attacks than might be expected and able to mitigate the effects of accuracy reducing attacks. This extends to GMs, where they will have a slightly better impression of Pok\00e9mon within their vicinity. Their Psychic support moves (such as Gravity and Magic Room) cost slightly less energy." ; }
span.task[tc-rock]:before { content: "Rock-type Pok\00e9mon generally have hard bodies, which makes them resistant to physical hits and projectiles. They are also resistant to XX attacks. This defensive ability extends to their moves, making defensive attacks like Protect and Harden cost less energy. They are difficult to burn or poison and prefer hot environments to cold ones. Most are so heavy that they will sink in water, so they stay away from deep-water sources if possible. They are adept at controlling rocks and will use less energy than other Pok\00e9mon when using Rock Tomb, Stealth Rock etc. to manipulate the arena." ; }
span.task[tc-steel]:before { content: "Steel-type Pok\00e9mon generally have tempered bodies, meaning they take slightly reduced damage from physical attacks. Their Steel type attacks are more proficient at cutting through energy, allowing them to reduce damage while breaking through them, unlike other Pok\00e9mon. Most are so heavy that they will sink in water, so they stay away from deep-water sources if possible, though they are not bothered by water to the degree Rock-types are. Most Steel Pok\00e9mon prefer cold temperatures to hot ones. Steel-types are resistant to XX and take neutral damage from the damaging effects of Normal-type energy in the ASB, as opposed to resisted damage in the games. They are immune to the damaging effects of Poison-type energy and are difficult to poison." ; }
span.task[tc-water]:before { content: "Water-type Pok\00e9mon are generally able to hold their breath and/or breathe underwater. The time varies, from several rounds in the case of birds, mammals and reptiles to indefinitely for fish and squid like Pok\00e9mon. They are generally good swimmers, with fish excelling the most, and are better at manipulating Water for moves like Surf and Whirlpool than other Pok\00e9mon, using less energy to do so even outside of water. Their Surf and Whirlpool attacks do not lose potency when used without a water source." ; }
